            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And what maie we thinke of them that be otherwiſe, that pamper them ſelues either in a blinde zeale without care of knowledge, the waie to error, or in a bare knowledge thinking themſelues wiſe deſpiſe the waie of the Lord, which is in true zeale and right knowledge of the Lordes waies according to his word. And their ſuch proude accompt of nothing, taking the very ſhadowe of knowledge for true knowledge it ſelf, maketh them ſecure, who of wiſe and zealous members of Gods Churche, according to the meaſure of their experience in that tyme, are now becomne vnprofitable Drones, and careleſſe Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and thinke them ſelues more wiſe (in their extreame follie) then euer thei were before.

            <p>Some others there are that take excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at whom thei wil, and albeit the Lord hath teſtified that there is no reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with hym,<note place="margin">Act. 10.34. Rom. 2.11.</note> yet thei feare not to vpholde

And that their ſuch dreaming may appeare the more groſſe, thei let not to ſaie, (with what purpoſe I leaue to them ſelues) that a woman ſhould not bee more religious then her houſbande, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng belike, the approued examples of the Scriptures <hi>1.

J wiſh we maie in this cleare light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge leaue winking, as it were, at noone da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, and tremble, thus to dallie, or thus to deale vniuſtly with the moſt holie truth of

            <p>If we in the truth of an humble ſoule do weigh the ſeuerall teſtimonies of the worde of the Lorde, to the right guiding of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts to the aſſuraunce of his grace in the obedience of his will, we ſhall eaſily be made able to meete with all theſe miſcheefes and many moe, that might otherwaies preuaile to turne vs out of the waie. And as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God hath amongst infinite other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture to that effect, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Sainct Ihon in his firſt Epiſtle, proued that true iuſtification and eternall life is onely by Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhewed further, that there is no aſſuraunce of this grace of the Lorde, where is not the effectuall power of the Spirite of the Sonne of God in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified (who are vnited vnto hym as the members vnto the head, and receiue of his fulneſſe) to leade them in a continuall true obedience of his will reuealed in his worde, and in the truthe thereof, that thei might ſtand out immouably vnto the end, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Whiche his labours, in regarde of the greate good thei might doe to many fearing the Lorde, that want the knowledge of the tongue wherein he wrote: I haue (as my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions haue giuen me leaue) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the Engliſhe tongue, and offryng my poore labours therein to the Churche of GOD, I haue been bolde to commende the firſt fruites, as it were, vnto you, right har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely praiyng, that whatſoeuer the Lord ſhall therein open vnto you, that maie concerne you through conuerſion, continuaunce, or

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7582:18"/> doe account howe miſerable and horrible the condition of death is: and agayne of what worthyneſſe the kingdome of GOD and his immortall glorye is: we ſhall héere perceiue ſome more excellent thing, then can bée expreſſed with anye wordes. This therefore is the purpoſe of the Apoſtle, when hée hath ſhewed the moſt excellent good thing, yea, the chiefe and alone happyneſſe, which GOD hath vouchſafed vs in his Sonne, to lighten our mindes. But becauſe the greatneſſe of the maker did require that the truth ſhould be certaine and approoued, hée tourneth much in this part. For all theſe <hi>Which wee haue ſeene, which wee haue hard, which wee haue looked vppon, &amp;c.</hi> are effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall to eſtabliſh the credite of the Goſpell.

                     <hi>Of the word of life.</hi> The Genitiue caſe is taken in the place of an Epithite for quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe as he teacheth in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Goſpell, In it was life: albeit this title doth belong to the Sonne of God by a double right, both becauſe he hath plentifully poured life vpon all creatures, and becauſe he now repaireth life in vs, which was put out and periſhed by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne. Yea, moreouer the name it ſelfe of the word, may be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two manner of waies, either of Chriſt, or of the doctrine of the Goſpel: for by that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, health is brought vnto vs. But, becauſe the ſubſtaunce thereof is Chriſt, and it doth not contayne anye other thing, then that hée at length was manifeſted vnto men, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7582:20"/> to be profitable to the preſent cauſe: For the vertue of Chriſt cannot bée comprehended with eyes or handes. I aunſwere that the ſame thing is ſpoken héere, which is in the firſt Chapter of his Goſpell: We haue ſéene his glorie, that is, glorie worthye the onely begotten Sonne of GOD. For the Sonne of GOD was not acknowledged according to the outwarde forme of his bodie: but by that whereas he ſhewed foorth famous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences of his diuine power: ſo that in him, as by a liuely and expreſſe Image, did ſhine the maieſtie of the Father.

                  <p>But, no leſſe friuolous, as I lately tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and to be ſhamed at, is the lewdneſſe of <hi>Seruetus,</hi> who vrgeth theſe wordes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to prooue that the worde of GOD hath bene viſible and palpable. Hée dooth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedlye either deſtroye the two Natures, which is in Chriſt, or mingle them confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7582:21"/>
                  <p>He therefore doth imagine I wot not what lie, ſo deifying the humanitie of Chriſt, that he doeth vtterly take from him the truth of mans nature, denying in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time that Chriſt is any other way the ſonne of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept becauſe he was conceiued of his mother by the power of the holye Ghoſt, and taking from him his proper abiding in God Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followeth, that he is neither God nor man, albeit he ſéeme to forge a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed Maſſe of both.

<pb facs="tcp:7582:24"/> of the teſtimonie, whereof he had made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a little before, the text ſéemeth rather to require the other ſenſe: except poſſiblye you may reſolue it thus, The promiſe, which wée bring vnto you, doth draw this with it, or hath this condition knitte vnto it. By this meanes we ſhal vnderſtand the minde of the Apoſtle. Neither indéede dooth hée héere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende the whole doctrine of the Goſpell: but ſheweth that this is requyred, if we will inioye Chriſt and his benefittes, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lyke vnto GOD in righteouſneſſe, and holyneſſe: lyke as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaieth. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. That Grace of GOD which bringeth ſaluation to all men hath appeared, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to denye vngodlyneſſe and worldly luſtes, and teacheth vs to lyue ſoberlye, iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and godlye, in this preſent worlde. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte becauſe hée teacheth by a Metaphore, that wée muſt walk in the light becauſe God is lyght.</p>
                  <p>Further, whereas ſometimes hée calleth GOD lyght, and ſometimes ſayeth, Hée is in the lyght, the wordes are not to be vrged too much. Why Sathan ſhoulde bée called the Prince of darkenes, it is euident inough. Therefore when GOD on the contrarye
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7582:24"/> parte is called the Father of light, and light it ſelfe, firſt wée may vnderſtande, that there is nothing in him, but that which is cleare, pure, and ſincere: then, that he dooth ſo ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all things with his brightneſſe, that hée ſuffereth nothing that is defiled or vnéeuen, no blemiſhes or vncleanneſſe, no hypocriſie or deceipt, nor any other euill to lye cloſe or hidde.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this is the Summe: Séeing there is no agréement betwéene lyght and darkeneſſe, that while wée walke in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wée are at enmitie with GOD.

Therefore the ſenſe is. That GOD is ſuch a lyght as that hée admitteth no darkneſſe at all. Wherevpon it followeth that hée dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye hate an euill conſcience, and a defiled, lewde, and wicked lyfe and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

For it is not indéede a bare precepte, whereby he doth require of vs an holy life, but rather he ſheweth that the grace of Chriſt is alſo effectuall vnto this, that the darkneſſe bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driuen awaie, it may kindle the lyght of God in vs. As if he ſhould haue ſayd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God doth communicate himſelfe with vs, it is no vaine counterfait, but it is of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that the power and effect of this ſocietie doe ſhew forth in our life, or elſe the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpell ſhall be counterfait. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he addeth, <hi>We doe not the truth.</hi> It is as much as if he ſhoulde haue ſayde, we doe not truly, or we haue not in eſtimation y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is true and right. And it is that manner of ſpeaking, which I noted firſt to be in plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vſe with him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 <hi>But if we walke in the light.</hi> Now hée ſaith that this is a certaine marke of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction with God, if we be made lyke vnto him, not that the pureneſſe of life dooe recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7582:25"/> God vnto vs as the firſt cauſe: but the Apoſtle meaneth, that by the effect it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that we are knit vnto God, if his pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe ſhine in vs. And indéede ſo is the matter, that whereſoeuer God doeth come, all things are ſo fully repleniſhed with his holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that wipeth awaie all vncleanneſſe: but without him wée haue nothing but vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; darkneſſe. Hence it appeareth that no man liueth well, except alſo he cleaue faſt vnto God. Where he ſayth that we haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe one with another, it is not ſimplie referred to men, but he placeth God on the one parte and vs on the other. Yet it may bée demaunded, what man canne ſo expreſſe the light of God in his lyfe, that this lykeneſſe which <hi>Iohn</hi> requyreth, maye bée appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, for by this meanes it muſt néedes be, that he is altogether cleane and without darkneſſe. I anſwere that theſe kinde of ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are to be fitted to the capacitie of men. Therefore he is ſayd to bée lyke vnto GOD, that doeth aſpire vnto his ſimilitude, howe farre ſo euer yet he be from the ſame. And no example is to be fetched elſe where, then from this preſent place.</p>

Therefore on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he that in the ſincere affection of his hart, conforming his lyfe and all the partes of it to the feare and obedience of God, doth pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhippe him, albeit he faile in manye things, and to moane vnder the burthen of the fleſh, hée is taken to walke in the light, becauſe he holdeth the right waie.

Pſalme. That we may know our ſelues to be moſt miſerable, vntil we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerate by the ſpirit of God, do ſerue him in a cleane heart. For what canne be thought more miſerable then man, whom god hath in hatred &amp; abhomination? Vpon whom together doth reſt the wrath of God &amp; eternal death? This is a place worthy noting, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7582:26"/> by the death of Chriſt, doth properly belong vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we imbrace righteouſnes with a right purpoſe of heart. For Chriſt is not a redéemer, but vnto them who béeing tourned from iniquitie, do lead a newe life. Wherfore if we deſire to haue God mercifull vnto vs, that he may forgiue our ſinnes, we muſt not excuſe our ſelues. Finally, from repentance, remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſeparate, neither can our conſciences haue peace with god, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of God doth not beare rule. Secondly, this place doth teach, that the frée forgiuenes of ſinnes is not once onely giuen vnto vs, but that this benefit remaineth perpetually in the Church, and is daily offered to the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For the Apoſtle doth héere ſpeake to the faithfull, as in truth there was neuer anie, nor euer ſhall be, which can otherwiſe pleaſe God, ſéeing all are holden with guiltineſſe before God. For whatſoeuer kinde of deſire to doe well be in vs, we alwaies goe vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to the Lord. Further, whatſoeuer is an halfe part, deſerueth no praiſe with God.

                  <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>From all ſinne,</hi> he doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, that by many meanes we are guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: as indéede there is no man that is not defiled with very many ſinnes. But hée teacheth that no ſinnes doo hinder the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſuch as feare God, wherby they may the leſſe pleaſe God. He alſo ſheweth the way to obtaine forgiueneſſe, and the cauſe of our being made cleane: that is, becauſe Chriſt hath purged our ſinnes with his bloud. But he affirmeth that all the godly ſhall vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be pertakers of this being made cleane from ſinne. This whole part of doctrine hath bene wickedly corrupted of the Schoolemen: for they fain, that the frée pardon of ſinnes, is onely giuen vnto vs in Baptiſme: they doe graunt, that there onely the bloud of Chriſt is effectuall. But after Baptiſme they teach, that we are no otherwiſe reconciled to God, then by ſatiſfactions. And héere they leaue indéede ſome part to the bloud of Chriſt: but when they aſcribe vnto workes, commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and power to ſatiſfie for ſinnes, and to pleaſe God, but in the leaſt meaſure, they doo wholly ouerthrow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith héere, For theſe wil neuer agrée betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, That we are purged by the bloud of Chriſt, and that workes are cleanſings from ſinne:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7582:27"/> becauſe <hi>Iohn</hi> here aſſigneth not the one halfe, but the whole to the bloud of Chriſt. This therefore is the ſumme, that the faithfull doo certainly aſſure themſelues, that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God: becauſe he is pacified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them by the Sacrifice of the death of Chriſt. Wherefore the power and effect of all theſe, reſteth in the onely bloude of Chriſt.

For this iuſtice depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth of faith, but each of them is anexed to the promiſe, for otherwiſe God may be iuſt, &amp; yet deale with vs in moſt high iuſtice: but becauſe he hath bound himſelfe to vs by his word, he will not be taken for iuſt except hée doe forgiue.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7582:30"/> and yet becauſe we are alwaies ſubiect to the iudgement of GOD, wée are certaine that Chriſt doth make interceſſion with the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of his death, that he maye reconcile the Father vnto vs. In the meane alſo he vſeth a predication, leaſt anie man ſhoulde thinke that he giueth libertie to ſinne, when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth of the mercie of GOD, and teacheth, that it is ſet forth vnto vs all. Hée therefore ioyneth together two partes of the Goſpell, which prepoſtrous men ſeparating, doe rend &amp; make lame the Goſpel it ſelfe. Further, the doctrine of grace hath euer ben ſubiect to the ſlaunders of wicked men: when the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes is ſet forth in Chriſt, then they bragge that there is graunted libertye to ſinne. That the Apoſtle maye méete with theſe miſchifes, at the firſt hée ſheweth that this is the end of his doctrine, that men ſhuld ceaſe to ſinne. For when he ſayth, <hi>That you ſhould not ſinne:</hi> He onely meaneth this, that they ſhould abſtaine from ſinne, as much as they are able for the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man.

And becauſe fleſh is prone vnto looſeneſſe, men are diligently to bée put in minde, that righteouſneſſe and ſaluation is therefore gotten by the death of Chriſt, that we may be an holy people of God. Yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it come to paſſe that many doo wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe the mercie of God, and alſo manye dogs doo ſlaunderouſly ſpeake euill of vs, as if we let looſe the reynes to wickedneſſe: wée muſt goe forward conſtauntly in auouching the grace of Chriſt, in which the glory of God doth moſt notably ſhine, and the whole ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man conſiſt.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate. For in this he appeareth before the face of God, that hée may ſhew foorth the efficacie of his ſacrifice towards vs. To the ende this may be better vnderſtood, I will ſpeak more plainly. The interceſſion of Chriſt, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall applying of his death vnto our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whereas therefore God dooth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute our ſinnes, hence it is becauſe he hath reſpecte vnto Chriſt, our earneſt Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.</p>
                  <p>But the two titles wherewith hée after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde adorneth Chriſt, doo properly belong
<pb facs="tcp:7582:32"/> to the circumſtaunce of this place. He calleth him <hi>Iuſt, and Reconciliation:</hi> It behooueth that he be indued with both, that he maye beare the office and perſon of an Aduocate: for what ſinner can obtaine for vs the fauor of God? For therefore we are all driuen from hauing acceſſe vnto him, becauſe no man is pure and voyd of ſinne. No man therefore is a fit high Prieſt, but he that is innocent and ſeperate from ſinners, as alſo is teſtified, <hi>Heb. 17. verſe 26. Reconciliation is added, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without Sacrifice, none is a fitte high Prieſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therfore vnder the Lawe, the Prieſt neuer went into the Sanctuarie without bloud: and Sacrifice with prayer, as if a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſeale were wont to bee added by the ordinaunce of GOD. By which token, GOD woulde haue it knowen, that hée which ſhoulde obtaine fauour for vs, muſt bée prepared with Sacrifice. For when God is offended, the price of ſatiſfaction to pacifie him is required. Hence it followeth, that all the Saints which haue bene, and which ſhal be, haue néede of an aduocate: and that there is none ſufficient to vndergoe this office but onely Chriſt. And in truth <hi>Iohn</hi> hath aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Chriſt theſe two Epethytes by name,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7582:32"/> that he might ſhewe him to be the onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate. And as there commeth vnto vs therby excéeding conſolation, when we heare that Chriſt dyed not onelye once, that hée might pacifie his Father towardes vs: but continuallye make interceſſion for vs, that the waye might bée open for vs vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name, that our prayers might bée hearde: ſo is it chiefelye to bée taken héede vnto, leaſt the honour that is appropriate and due to him alone, be tranſferred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>But we knowe in the Papiſtrie, this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was aſcribed indifferently to the Saints. Nowe there bée almoſt thirtie yeares, ſince this excellent Principle of our Faith was almoſt buryed: That Chriſt is our Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. They confeſſe in déede at this daye that there is one of manye, but not alone. They that among the Papiſtes haue ſome more modeſtye, denye not that Chriſt dooth excell aboue all other Aduocates whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but neuertheleſſe afterwardes they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate vnto him, a great rabblement of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. But the wordes of <hi>Iohn</hi> in this place doo plainlye manifeſt, that hée can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in anye wiſe bée an Aduocate, that is not a Prieſt.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7582:33"/>
                  <p>Further the Prieſthoode appertaineth vnto none but vnto Chriſt alone. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time we take not awaie the mutual interceſſion of Saints, whereby among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe charity. But this is nothing to them that are dead, who are ſeparate from the felowſhip of men, and nothing to thoſe defences which they counterfait to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, leaſt they ſhuld onely cleaue to Chriſt. For albeit that brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren pray for their bretheren, yet without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they all reſpect one head defender. It is therefore no doubt, but the Papiſts doe ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt euen ſo manye Idolles, as they imagine Patrones vnto themſelues. But if is to be noted by the waie, that they erre too groſely, which tumble Chriſt at his Fathers knées, that he might praie for vs. Such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations muſt be taken awaie which dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the diuine glorie of Chriſt: and the ſimple doctrine is to be held, that the fruite of his death doe remaine freſh and perpetuall for vs, that by his interceſſion he reconcileth God vnto vs, and as well doeth ſanctifie our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the ſwéete ſmell of his ſacrifice, as help them by the fauour of his ſupportation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Not for ours alone.</hi> He hath added this for amplification ſake, that the faythfull may be aſſuredly perſwaded, that the redemption
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7582:33"/> gotten by Chriſt is extended to al, which ſhal receiue the Goſpel in faith. But héere is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. How the ſinnes of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhould be done away? I omit the dotages of ſuch franticke fellowes, who vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this, admit to ſaluation all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, moreouer Sathan himſelfe. Such a monſtrous fantaſie, is not worthie the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. They that would eſcape this abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, haue ſaid, that Chriſt ſuffered ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the whole world: but onely effectually for the elect. This ſolution hath commonlye preuailed in the ſchooles. Albeit that I grant that ſaying to be true, yet I denie that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréeth with this place. For <hi>Iohn</hi> had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſe, then to make this good common to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole Church. Therefore vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word <hi>All</hi> he dooth not comprehend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reprobate: but pointeth out thoſe which together were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, &amp; wer ſcattered into diuers parts of the worlde. For then is the grace of Chriſt made manifeſt as is méet, when he is preched to be the only ſauing health of the world.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 AFter he hath handled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the frée remiſſion of ſins, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth againe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exhortations annexed, &amp; dependeth vpon it: &amp; firſt he admoniſheth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of God, which is conceiued by the Goſpell is not idle: but doth of it ſelfe bring forth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Afterwards, he ſheweth, what God doth eſpecially require of vs, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe in our life: namely, that we loue God. That which we read héere of the effectuall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the Scripture doth not euerye where repeate without cauſe: for ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more common to the worlde, then to draw the doctrine of godlineſſe to vaine ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. After this manner was diuinitie adulterated among the ſophiſticall Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of all their knowledge, not ſo much as the leaſt ſpark of godlines could appeare. And vaine men euery where doo onely learn from the word of God, that which they may babble out for oftentation ſake. Finally, in all ages, this was too common an euil, to talk
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7582:34"/> vainly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God. <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this principle, That the knowledge of God is effectuall. Wherevpon he gathereth, that they doo not know God, that kéepe not his commandements. <hi>Plato,</hi> though greping in the darke in <hi>Phaedro,</hi> and other places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, that that excellent beautie which hée imagineth can be knowen, but that it will forceably carrie a man into the admiration of it. Therfore how may it be, that thou canſt know God, &amp; be touched with no affection? Neither indéede doth this procéede onely from the nature of God, that we immediatelye loue him whome wée knowe: but the ſame ſpirit which doth lighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our minds, doth lyke wiſe breath into our hartes an affection like vnto our knowledge. Albeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of God bringeth this with it, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we feare &amp; loue him: for neither can we acknowledge him as he ſheweth himſelf to be Lord &amp; father, except we yéelde our ſelues againe to him obedyent children and dutifull ſeruaunts. Briefly, the doctrine of the goſpel is a liuely glaſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we beholding the image of God, are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into it, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore where there is not preſent a good conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhew of knowledge cannot be but vaine. This is to be marked when he ſaith,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:35"/> 
                     <hi>That we know that we haue knowen.</hi> For he noteth that obedience of God is ſo knit vnto the knowledge, that yet knowledge bée firſt in order: as it is of neceſſitie, that the cauſe be before the effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If we keepe his commaundements.</hi> But there is no man, that doth kéepe them in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie part. By that meanes then ſhould bée no knowledge of God in the world? I anſwere, that the Apoſtle is not at oddes with himſelf. When therefore he had lately ſet all men in guiltines before God, he doth not vnderſtand that they kéepe the commaundements, which ſatiſfie the lawe in all poynts (which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can no where be found in the world): but thoſe which labour to conforme their life to the obedience of God, ſo much as in regard of mans infirmitie they can. For ſo often as the Scripture ſpeaketh of the righteouſneſſe of the faithfull, it is ſo farre off from excluding the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, that rather it dooth take the beginning from it. Neither indéede is it to be gathered from thence, that faith do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth leane vpon workes. For albeit that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one hath the witneſſe of his faith, from works: yet it foloweth not that it is founded there, ſéeing that this latter proofe is added for a ſigne. The aſſurance therefore of faith,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7582:35"/> reſteth in the alone grace of Chriſt: but god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and holineſſe of life diſcerneth true faith from a counterfaite &amp; dead knowledge of God: becauſe this truth is in Chriſt: as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, to haue put off the old man, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>He that ſaith, I know him.</hi> Whereby prooueth he that they lye, which boaſt of faith without godlineſſe?

But becauſe that many hypocrits doo vainly pamper the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with the title of faith, the Apoſtle doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince ſuch of a lie. For that which he ſayth ſhuld be ſuperfluous, except the falſe &amp; vaine profeſſion of Chriſtianitie, did rule in the mouths of many.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>But he that kepeth.</hi> Now he ſheweth which is the true obſeruing of the law of God: that is to wit, to loue god. This place in my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is euill expounded of them, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they truely pleaſe God, which kéepe his word. Rather expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it thus: To loue God with a ſincere affection of hart, is to kéepe his commaundements. For briefly, as I haue touched alreadie, his purpoſe was to
<pb facs="tcp:7582:36"/> ſhew what god doth require of vs. The ſame alſo did <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaye, when he gathered the ſumme of the lawe, <hi>Deut</hi> 10. <hi>Now Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law which is ſpiritual, doth not onely giue commandement of external things: but chiefly it doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we loue God w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our whole hart. Becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> here is no mention made of men, it is not to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for an abſurd thing. For brotherly loue doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies iſſue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of God: as afterwards we ſhall ſée. Whoſoeuer therefore deſireth to approue his life vnto God, let him direct all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts therof to this end. If any obiect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was neuer any man found, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo perfectly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued god. I anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſufficeth, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſure of the grace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> is giuen him, doo aſpire vnto this perfection. In the meane time y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is manifeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the perfect loue of God, is the due obſeruing of his word.</p>

And whereas he firſt ſet downe the loue in God, and nowe of brethren, there is no more repugnaunce then betwixt the effect and the cauſe. Finally, they are ſo knit together of themſelues, that they cannot bée ſeparated. <hi>Iohn</hi> will after ſaie in the third chapter, that we doe falſely boaſt of the loue of God, except
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7582:39"/> wée loue the brethren. And that is moſt true. But now he taketh the loue to our brethren as a teſtimonie whereby we proue that wée loue God. In ſumme, ſéeing loue doth ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect God, that in God it comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth men: there is no abſurditie in that, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle diſputing of loue, doth referre it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, ſometimes to God, and ſometimes to the brethren. And this is a common vſe of the Scripture. Often times the whole perfection of life is placed in the loue of God. Againe, <hi>Paule Rom.</hi> 13.8. teacheth, that he fulfilleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe which loueth his brother. And Chriſt ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principal things of the lawe, Righteouſneſſe, iudgement, and truth. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. And both is true, and doth moſt fitly agrée, becauſe both the loue God direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of men, &amp; we do indéed wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe our diuine affection towards god by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of men at his commandement. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be, let this euer remaine firme, that loue is the rule of the direction of lyfe, which is ſo much the more diligently to be marked, becauſe all almoſt do rather chooſe any thing, then this onely commandement of God. To the ſame effect belongeth that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That ther is no offence, where is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of loue, for he that ſo frameth his life ſhal
<pb facs="tcp:7582:40"/> neuer offend.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 <hi>He that hateth his brother.</hi> Againe, he admoniſheth, that although thou make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſhew of vertue, yet there is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not filthie where loue is abſent.

But this doctrine is therefore obſcure to the worlde, becauſe the greater part are aſtoniſhed with I know not what maſkes.

Whereon it followeth, that there is nothing héere which they may diſdaine. Whereas he ſaith, that Chriſt was <hi>from the beginning.</hi> I refer it as wel to his diuine preſence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is coeternal with the Father, as to that power whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh to the Hebrues. 13.8. Where he ſaith he was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day as he is to day. As if he had ſayd: If old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe like you, you haue Chriſt, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth all antiquitie. Wherefore bée not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to bée his Diſciples, who compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth all worldes in himſelfe. In the meane time is to bée noted, which is indéede the olde Religion, verily euen that which is
<pb facs="tcp:7582:43"/> grounded in Ieſus Chriſt. For otherwiſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo long a courſe of yeares ſhall be little worth, if it take the beginning from error. <hi>I write to you young men.</hi> Albeit he vſeth a diminitiue <hi>[Neaniſcoi] young men.</hi> Yet there is no doubt but he directeth his ſpéech to all men, which are in the good ſtate and flowre of their yeares. We knowe further, that that age is ſo addicted to the vaine cares of the world, that it thinketh little of the kingdome of God. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſharpneſſe of wit and ſtrength of bodie, doe as it were make them dronke: Therefore the Apoſtle doeth admoniſh them, where true ſtrength doth conſiſt, leaſt accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their manner they boaſt in the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Now ſaith he, <hi>Are ſtrong, becauſe you haue ouercome Sathan.</hi> For the note of coupling is of equall force, as a perticular cauſal, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede it is that valiancie which men ought greatly to deſire: that is to ſaye, a ſpirituall. And together he ſheweth that it is no other where had, then of Chriſt. For he putteth in minde of thoſe good things which we receiue by the Goſpell. He ſaith they haue vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed which are yet in the verie act of warre: But our eſtate is farre other, then theſe that were vnder the ſtandard of men. For the battaile is doubtfull to them, and the iſſue

                  <p n="14">14 <hi>I write to you children.</hi> Children néed the gouernment of another, therefore the Apoſtle doth gather, that the goſpell doth moſt fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with children, becauſe there they maye finde the father.

But theſe things which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle hath ſorted into ſpecialls, are indéed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls.

Furthermore, in the Popedome, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of account and vſuall, then that Antichriſt ſhall come. In the meane time they are ſo beſotted, that they eſpie not his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie that is yoaked vnto their necks. The ſame thing in truth is come vnto them, that was vnto the Iewes. For albeit they holde the promiſes of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> yet are they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from Chriſt, then if they had neuer heard of his name: for the imagined <hi>Meſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> which they haue fained to themſelues, hath vtterly tourned them awaye from the ſonne of God. And if any by the Lawe and the prophets go about to bring them to the knowledge of Chriſt, he ſhal doo nothing but looſe his labour. The Papiſtes imagine an

All the notes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God doth point out Antichriſt, doo euidently appeare in the Pope: but that thrée yeares Antichriſt dooth hold the fooliſh Papiſts occupied, leaſt in ſéeing they ſhould ſee. Let vs remember therefore, that the ſpirit of God did not onely ſhewe that Antichriſt ſhould come, but together ſette downe ſure markes, by which he might be knowen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, euen now there are many.</hi> This maye ſéeme to be added in ſtéed of a correction: as if they vntruly ſuppoſed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be ſome one kingdome: but it is not ſo.

Firſt he foretelleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falling awaye, which ſhall ſpred it ſelfe ouer all the church, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may be as it wer a general euil: then he aſſigneth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> general head of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduerſary of Chriſt: which ſhal ſit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temple of god, vſurping diuine honor to himſelf. Except we will be blind of purpoſe, we may learne by this diſcription of <hi>Paul</hi> to know Antichriſt, which I haue expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in his place: now it ſufficeth to touch it a little.
<pb facs="tcp:7582:49"/> But how ſhall this agrée with the words of <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſaith, that there are now manie? I aunſwere, that <hi>Iohn</hi> meaneth nothing els, then that ſeuerall ſects begin to ariſe, which were forerunners of the falling away. For <hi>Cherinthus, Baſilides, Martion, Valentinus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bion, Arrius,</hi> and the reſt, were members of that Kingdome, which the diuell afterward ſet vp againſt Chriſt. To ſpeake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Antichriſt indéede was not yet come, but the myſterie of his impietie did priuelye work. 2. <hi>The.</hi> 2.7. But <hi>Iohn</hi> vſeth this name, that he might the more ſtirre vp the indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and care of the godly, to beate backe their falſhoods. But if the ſpirit of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the faithfull euen then to watch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, when they did onely ſée a farre off the ſignes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enimie to come: much leſſe is it now a time of ſléeping, when he oppreſſeth the Church with moſt cruell tyrannie, and doth openly ſet himſelfe againſt Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 <hi>They went out from among vs.</hi> Hée preuenteth another obiection, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church did ſéeme to haue begotten thoſe miſchiefes, and for a time nouriſhed them in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. For in truth it is of more force to trouble the weake, if any one who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed one faith with vs doo fall away, then
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7582:49"/> if a thouſand that are without ſhuld conſpire againſt vs. He therefore ſo confeſſeth that they came out of the boſome of the Church, that he yet denieth, that they were euer of the Church. Further the way to deduce the obiection, is, that the Church is alwaies ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to this euill, that is, conſtrained to beare manye hypocrites, which in truth haue not Chriſt, howſoeuer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their mouth they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his name for a time. When he ſaith, <hi>They went out from vs,</hi> he ſignifieth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did firſt occupie a roome in the Church, and were accompted in the number of the godly. Yet he denieth that they were of vs, becauſe they did falſly pretend the name of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, euen as chaffe albeit it is mingled with wheate in one floore, yet is not accompted to be of the wheate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If they had bene of vs.</hi> He dooth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce that they wer neuer members of the church which fall away. And in truth the ſeale of God vnder which he kéepeth his, remaineth ſure, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. But héere ariſeth an hard thing: For it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falleth out, that manye who ſéemed to haue imbraced Chriſt, doo fall awaye. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that there are thrée ſorts of them that profeſſe Chriſt. For there are, which doo but
<pb facs="tcp:7582:50"/> counterfaite godlyneſſe, while yet an euill conſcience dooth inwardly conuince them. The hypocriſie of others is more deceiptfull, which doo not onelye indeauour to make a vaine ſhewe before men, but ſhut their eyes, that they maye ſéeme to themſelues to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe GOD aright. The thirde haue a liuely roote of Faith, and they carrie in their hearts firmely grounded, a witneſſe of their adoption.</p>
                  <p>The two firſt degrées haue not any thing of aſſurance, of the laſt <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh when hée ſaith, it is not poſſible they ſhoulde be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated from the Church: nor can the ſeale which God hath imprinted in their heartes, bée taken awaye. The incorruptible ſéede, that hath taken roote, can not bée plucked vp nor aboliſhed. And héere the queſtion is not of the conſtancie of men, but of the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of GOD, whoſe election muſt néedes bée ſure. Wherefore hée ſayeth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, where the callyng of GOD is effectuall, that there is a ſure perſeueraunce. In ſumme he meaneth that they were neuer rightly indued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of Chriſt, which fall away: but had onely a light and vncertaine taſt.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7582:51"/> rude &amp; ignoraunt of thoſe things, which they ought very well to knowe. So <hi>Paul</hi> yéeldeth wiſedome to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they might be able and fit to admoniſh others. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.14. Yet together he ſheweth that he could not otherwiſe perfourme the dutie that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned him, except he did admoniſh them.</p>
                  <p>And yet the Apoſtles doo not flatteringlye ſpeake ſo: but by this meanes they doo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſée, leaſt their doctrine ſhould be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any ſorts of men, while they ſhew that it agréeth and is profitable not onely to the rude people, but euen to thoſe that be lerned in the Lords ſchoole. Experience it ſelfe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, how diſdainfull the eares of men bée. Indeede ſuch irkſomneſſe muſt be far from the godly: yet it is the parte of a good and wiſe teacher to let paſſe nothing, whereby he may make all willing to heare him. And it is certaine that we receiue with leſſe héede &amp; reuerence that which is ſpoken, if wée ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that hée which ſpeaketh, dooth take from vs the knowledge which is giuen of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle dooth together ſharpen the readers with this proceſſe: becauſe they haue the leſſe excuſe, which are indued with the gifte of vnderſtanding, except they goe before
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7582:51"/> others in profiting. The ſumme is, that the apoſtle dooth not teach them as rude and ſuch as learne but their principles, but he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to their minde the things which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie know: and then he exhorteth them to ſtirre vp the ſparkes of the ſpirite, that the full brightneſſe maye ſhine in them. And he expoundeth himſelfe in the next words, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that he wrote to them, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not the truth, but becauſe they were well inſtructed in it. For if they had bene ignoraunt and nouiſes, they could not haue vnderſtood this doctrine, And wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as he ſaith, <hi>They know all things,</hi> it muſt not be vnderſtoode generally, but reſtrained to the circumſtances of the preſent place.</p>
                  <p>But whereas he ſaith, they haue an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting of that <hi>Holy one.</hi> I doubt not but he alludeth to the olde Figures. For out of the Sanctuarie there was oyle taken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynt the Prieſts. But <hi>Daniel.</hi> 7.24. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the comming of Chriſt is the proper time of annoynting with the holy of holieſt. For therefore was he annoynted of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might poure forth vppon vs, much plentie of his owne fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence it followeth that men are not rightly wiſe by the ſharpneſſe of their owne
<pb facs="tcp:7582:52"/> vnderſtanding: but by the inlyghtening of the Spirite: and then that we are no waies made pertakers of the Spirite but by Chriſt, who is the true Sanctuarie, and our alone high Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 <hi>And that no lye.</hi> Hée graunteth that they haue iudgement whereby they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne truth from falſhood. And this propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not Logicall, That a lye differeth from the truth, (as generall Rules are giuen in Schooles) but the ſpeach is applyed to Vſe and Practiſe. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, that they doo not onelye holde that which is true, but are armed alſo, agaynſt the ſubtiltyes and deceyptes of the wicked, that they maye wiſely looke to themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Further, hée ſpeaketh not of one or two kinde of lyes: but whatſoeuer crafte Satan goeth about, or by what meane ſoeuer he ſet vpon them, that the wiſedome to diſcerne lyght from darkeneſſe, was alwayes readye with them, becauſe they are guyded by the Spirite.</p>

And that which hée had generally touched of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hée nowe applyeth to the ſtate of his owne time. For hée dooth with the finger poynt them out which troubled the Church. Whereas the olde Writers thought, that <hi>Cherinthus</hi> and <hi>Carpocrates</hi> were noted out, I eaſelye receyue it. But the denying of Chriſt ſtretcheth farre.

                  <p>Thoſe two Heretykes whome I haue before named, gaue the title of Chriſt to the Sonne of God: but yet they vntruely helde him to bée onely man.

                  <pb facs="tcp:7582:53"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martion</hi> dreamed that he was but the image of a man. <hi>Sabellius</hi> fayned that hée differed nothing from his Father. They all denyed him to bée the Sonne of God: becauſe none of them did rightly know the whole Chriſt: but falſifiyng his truth as much as in them was, they haue for Chriſt framed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues an Idoll. Then brake out <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who indéed mooued no controuerſie of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, but graunted that hée was true God and man: but hée tranſlated almoſt all his honour vnto vs. But this is to bring Chriſt to nothing, when his power &amp; grace is aboliſhed. So the Papiſts at this daye, ſetting frée will agaynſt the grace of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, placing parte of our righteouſneſſe and ſaluation in the deſarte of workes, fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning infinite Patrones to themſelues, by whome they may haue God fauourable, they haue I wot not what counterfayte Chriſt: but the lyuely and naturall Image of God, which ought to ſhine in Chriſt, they deface with their wicked inuentions, they weaken his power, they ouerthrowe and peruert his office.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This is Antichriſt.</hi> He ſpeaketh not of that Prince of falling away, which ſhould fit in the ſeate of God: but hée putteth them in that wicked rabblement, whoſoeuer ſtriue to ouerturne Chriſt. And that he might increaſe their ſinne, he ſayth, that they denie no leſſe the Father then the ſonne: as if he ſhoulde haue ſayd, That they haue no more religion, becauſe they haue vtterlye caſt awaie God, which he ſtraight confirmeth by a reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: becauſe the Father cannot be ſeparated from the ſon.

This ſecond point muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bée adioyned. That hée is no other, but
<pb facs="tcp:7582:54"/> which is knowen in Chriſt. Neither doth the Apoſtle héere cunningly diſpute of the vnitie of béeing. It is certaine indéed that the ſonne cannot bée ſeparated awaie from the Father, becauſe he is <hi>[Omoùſios]</hi> that is, <hi>One ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce:</hi> but nowe there is another thing in hande: namely, that the Father who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is inuiſible, hath onelye made himſelfe knowen in the ſon. Whervpon he is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the image of the Father: becauſe he doth repreſent and deliuer vnto vs whatſoeuer is profitable to be knowen of the father. For the alone maieſtie of God doth alwayes darken our eyes with his infinit brightneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is of neceſſitie that we looke vnto Chriſt. Héere is acceſſe to the light, which is otherwiſe worthely ſayd to bée vnable to bée come vnto.

                     <hi>If it abide in you.</hi> This is the fruit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeueraunce, that in whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, they abide in God. Wherevpon we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what is to be ſought in al the doctrine of godlineſſe. Wherfore he indéed hath excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie profited, who hath gone thus farre, that he cleaueth wholy vnto God. And in whome ſo euer the father doth not dwell by the ſonne, he is whollye vaine and vnprofitable, what knowledge ſoeuer he haue. Further, this is an excellent practiſe of ſound doctrine, becauſe it ioyneth vs to God, and we find in it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer belongeth to the true inioying of God. In the laſt place he ſheweth vs, that this is the chiefe happineſſe if God dwell in vs. The ſpéech that he vſeth is doubtfull: either that this is the promiſe, whereby he hath promiſed vnto vs eternall lyfe: or appoſitiuelye, that this is the promiſe which he hath giuen vs, namely, eternall lyfe. Becauſe yet that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waye thou takeſt it, the meaning is all one: let the choyce bée frée. The ſumme is, that there is no other waye for vs to lyue, then if wée nouriſhe continuallye to the end, the ſéede of life receiued in our mindes. <hi>Iohn</hi> is plentifull in ſetting downe this point, that not onely the beginning of an happie lyfe is placed in the knowledge of Chriſt, but alſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7582:56"/> perfection. But no repeating of it can bée too much, ſéeing it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this hath alwaies ben y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of deſtruction to men, becauſe not being conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt, they haue delighted to range beyond y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſimple doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="26">26 <hi>Theſe things I haue written vnto you.</hi> The Apoſtle doth againe excuſe it, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them, who otherwiſe had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; iudgement. And this he doth that they may adioyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgement of the ſpirite, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> admonition be fruitles. As if he ſhuld haue ſaid, I doe thoſe things that belong to me: but it is of neceſſitie in the meane time that the ſpirit of God doe guide you in al things. For in vaine ſhall I beat your eare, or rather the aire with the ſounde of my voice, excepte hée ſpeake within. When wée heare that hée hath written of deceyuers, let vs alwayes marke that this charge doeth euer lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a good and painefull Paſtour, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye that hée gather together the ſhéepe, but alſo that hée roote out and driue awaie all rauening Wolues. For what ſhall it auaile to ſette abroade the pure voyce of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, if wée winke at the manifeſt deceites of Sathan. Therefore there is not anye man that canne faythfully teach the Church, except he binde himſelfe to repreſſe errours,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:57"/> if he ſée anie caſt abroade of the deceiuers. Where he ſaith, the annointing <hi>Which yee haue receiued of him,</hi> I referre it to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="27">27 <hi>Ye haue no neede. Iohn</hi> had bene to be laughed at, as I ſayd before, if he had broched an vnprofitable doctrine. He doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſcribe vnto them ſo much knowledge, that he denie them to be Chriſtes Schollers. He onely ſignifieth, that they are not ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that they ſhould be taught as of things vnknowen: and that he did not propound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing which the ſpirit of God did not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily prompt vnto them. Therefore mad men doe wickedly abuſe this teſtimonie, that they might ſhutte out of the Church the vſe of the outward miniſtrie. Hée ſaith that the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are taught by the office of the ſpirite, to kéepe thoſe thinges that he deliuereth, that they haue no néede to learne them as things vnknowen. This he ſayth to the ende that he may procure the more account to his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: while euerie one findeth his ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on written in his heart with the finger of God. But, ſéeing that euerie one vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth according to the meaſure of faith, &amp; that faith in ſome is ſmall, in ſome meane, and in none abſolute: hence it followeth that no man knoweth ſo much, but that there is yet
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7582:57"/> place to further going forward. And then this is another profit of the doctrine, that where men hold faſt that is méete, yet we warn the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſtir them vp, that thereby they may haue a greater increaſe.</p>
                  <p>For in that <hi>Iohn</hi> teſtifieth that they are taught in all things by the ſpirit, it muſt not be ſo generallye taken: but reſtrained to the circumſtance of the preſent place. In ſumme, he meneth nothing elſe, but to confirme their faith, while he recalleth them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trial of the ſpirit, who only is a fit examiner &amp; approuer of the doctrine, while hée ſealeth vp the ſame in our heartes, that we may know of a truth that God ſpeaketh. For ſéeing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> faith ought to looke vnto God, he onely can be a witneſſe vnto himſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may perſwade our hearts that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> procéedeth from him which our eares receiue. And that is the meaning of thoſe wordes, <hi>As it teacheth you and is the truth.</hi> That is, that the ſpirite is like a ſeale, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is witneſſed vnto vs the truth of GOD. Where he addeth, <hi>It is not a lye.</hi> This perty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular noteth out the other office of the ſpirit, namely, that he gouerneth vs by iudgement and diſcreation, leaſt wée bée deceiued with a lye: leaſt wée depende vncertaine and in doubt, leaſt wée ſhoulde bée as it were neuer
<pb facs="tcp:7582:58"/> in vncertaine things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As he hath taught you, continue.</hi> He had ſayd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſpirite remained in them: Now he exhorteth that they remaine in his reuealati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And he noteth out the manner of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealation. Abide, ſaith he, in Chriſt, as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath taught you. I know it is commonly otherwiſe expounded, Abide in it: that it may note out the annointing. But ſéeing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition which by and by foloweth, can agrée to none but vnto Chriſt. I doubt not but here alſo he ſpeaketh of Chriſt: and the courſe of the Text doth require the ſame. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tarryeth in that point, that the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full would kéepe ſure the pure knowledge of Chriſt, and that they ſtriue not anie other waye to rome to God. In the meane time he doth cléerely ſhew, that the children of God are lightened of the ſpirit to no other ende, but that they maye knowe Chriſt. But if they ſhall not decline from thence, he ſetteth forth the fruites of perſeueraunce: namely, that they ſhall haue aſſuraunce not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed at his preſence. For faith is not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; cold apprehending of Chriſt, but a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; effectuall féeling of his power, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth aſſurance.

Our heauenlye Father ſayth hée hath vouchſafed to dignifie vs with no ſmall honour, ſéeing hée hath adopted vs to bée his ſonnes. This ſo greate fauour ought to kindle in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7582:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> vs the ſtudie of godlyneſſe, that wée maye bée lyke vnto him: and it canne no other way be done, except he which confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bée one of the ſonnes of GOD, doe purifie himſelfe. And the more vehement the exhortation is, the more is ſet foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the grace of almightie God. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſayth that loue is giuen vs, hée ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this commeth of méere liberalitie, that God accepteth vs for his children. For whence become we of ſuch account, but by the loue of God? Furthermore, his frée loue is héere manifeſtlye ſpoken of. It is indéede an vnproper kinde of ſpéech, but the Apoſtle had rather ſpeake vnproperlye, then not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that which was of neceſſitie to bée knowen. Briefelye, hée ſignifieth that the more plentifull the loue of GOD is ſhewed vppon vs, the more wée are bound vnto him, as <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Romanes</hi> the 12.1. beſéecheth the <hi>Romanes</hi> by the mercies of God, that they would offer themſelues vnto him an holye Sacrifice. In the meane time we are taught, that as I ſayde the adoption of all the godlye is frée, and dependeth not vppon anie reſpect of workes. For that which the Schoole men ſay, that they are adopted whom god did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſée to be worthie, is plainely made of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:7582:60"/> by theſe wordes. For by this meanes the gift of God ſhould not haue bene frée: This chiefe point of doctrine is principally néedfull to holde. For ſéeing that the onely cauſe of our ſaluation is adoption, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle witneſſeth that the ſame doth iſſue from the méere and alone loue of God, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remaineth to our owne worthineſſe or the deſert of works. For why are we ſonnes? Verily becauſe God hath begunne to loue vs fréely, when we were more worthie of hatred then of loue. And ſéeing that the ſpirit is the pledge of our adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: hence it followeth, that if there be anie good thing in vs, it muſt not be ſo ſet againſt the grace of God, that rather it muſt be aſcribed vnto it, as receiued from it. The <hi>Name</hi> whereof he ſpeaketh cannot be a vaine title. For it is God who pronounceth vs with his owne mouth to be his ſonnes: as he gaue a name to <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the thing it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the world.</hi> This temptation doth vehemently aſſayle our faith, that wée ſhould not ſo be accounted for the children of God, or haue anie note of ſuch excellencie ſéene in vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rather the whole world almoſt doth hold vs for a mocking ſtocke. Therefore by the preſent condition it can hardly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7582:60" rendition="simple:additions"/> that God is our Father: for the diuell inuenteth all wayes to darken his bleſſing. He giueth a remedie to this offence when hée ſaith, That it is not yet knowen <hi>What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men we are,</hi> becauſe the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not God: therefore it is no meruaile, if it contempne his children. Of which thing ther was a notable paterne in <hi>Iſaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob.</hi> For when each of them was elected of God, the one <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſcoffed and ieſted at <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.9. &amp; 27.41. the other <hi>Eſau</hi> perſecuted w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings &amp; with ſwoord.

                  <p n="2">2 <hi>We are now the ſonnes of God.</hi> Now he deſcendeth to euery ones proper feeling. For albeit the wicked doe not intice vs to caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our hope, yet our preſent eſtate is far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. For in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body we are duſt, &amp; a thing of nothing: death is euer before our eies, &amp; we are in danger of many miſeries, &amp; the ſoule is ſubiect to infinit euils: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we alwaies find hel in our ſelues.

For this is

                  <p>
                     <hi>And we know that when we ſhall be made manifeſt.</hi> This condition muſt be chaunged into an Aduerb of time where, or when. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this worde <hi>ſhall appeare,</hi> is taken other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then before. The Apoſtle ſayde a lyttle before, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it appereth not yet what we ſhal be, ſince the fruit of our adoption is hid: becauſe our felicitie is in heauen, and we are ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers farre from thence in the earth, &amp; becauſe this fraile life that is ſubiect to an hundreth deaths, is farre vnlike to that eternall glorye which belongeth to the children of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being ſhut vp after a ſlauiſhe manner in the priſon of fleſh, we are farre diſtaunt from the frée dominion of heauen and earth. But nowe he referreth this note to Chriſt, <hi>When hee ſhall appeare.</hi> For hée teacheth the ſame thing that <hi>Paule</hi> doeth vnto the <hi>Colloſ.</hi> chapter. 3. verſe. 3. where he ſayth, Your life is hidde with Chriſt: but when Chriſt which is your lyfe ſhall appeare, then ſhall yée alſo appeare with him in glory. And indéede our fayth can no other waye remaine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7582:61" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtedie, then while it looketh vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of Chriſt. For this is the cauſe why God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deferre the manifeſtation of our glory: becauſe Chriſt is not yet made manifeſt in the power of his kingdome. This I ſay, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely prop of our faith, that we may pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waite for the life that is promiſed vs. So ſoone as any one dooth turne aſide but a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from Chriſt, it cannot be choſen but hée ſhall faint.</p>
                  <p>By the word <hi>Knowe,</hi> he noteth out the certaintie of Faith, that he maye diſcerne it from opinion. Neither is héere noted a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vniuerſal knowledge, but that which euery one ought to apply to himſelfe, that he may know of a truth, that he ſhall once bée made lyke vnto Chriſt. Therefore howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the giuing forth of our glorie is deferred to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, yet the knowledge of it is moſt excellently aſſured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Like.</hi> He dooth not meane that we ſhall be equall, but there muſt néedes be ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwéene the head and the members: but we ſhall be like him, becauſe hée ſhall make our vile bodie like to his glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as <hi>Paule</hi> teacheth. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle goeth about to ſhew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is the laſt end of our adoption, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which by order went
<pb facs="tcp:7582:62"/> before in Chriſt, be at the laſt fulfilled in vs. Yet the reaſon that is added, ſéemeth to bée weake. For if the beholding of Chriſt ſhall make vs lyke vnto Chriſt, the wicked ſhall haue the ſame glorie with vs, who alſo ſhall ſée him. I aunſwere, that this is a familiar kinde of beholding, which the wicked cannot beare, but be ſore amazed: yea ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they ſhall horribly feare, and flye from the ſight of God: his glorie ſhal blind their eyes euen ſo that they ſhall be amazed with confuſion. For we ſée howe <hi>Adam</hi> knowing his owne euill, fled from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. And God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that generally vpon all men by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> No man ſhall ſée me and liue, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. Becauſe it cannot otherwiſe be, but that the maieſtie of God as a conſuming fire, doo conſume vs as ſtubble: ſuch is the weaknes of our fleſh. And as the Image of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in vs, we haue eyes prepared to the ſéeing of God. And now indéede God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to reſtore his image in vs: but in how ſmall a meaſure? Therefore except we be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of all the corruption of our fleſh, we cannot ſée God face to face. Which alſo is expreſſed in this note, <hi>Such as he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neyther dooth hée nowe take from vs all
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7582:62"/> ſight of God in this life: but ſo as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Now we ſée as in a glaſſe by a darke ſpeaking. And this kinde of ſéeing with an eye beholdinge, hée diſcerneth elſe where. In ſumme, God ſetteth foorth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe now to be ſéene of vs, not ſuch as he is, but ſuch as our ſmall capacitie can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende him. So is fulfilled that which is ſet downe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> that we ſée him onely as it were on the backpart. <hi>Exo.</hi> 33.23. Becauſe in his face there is an ouer-paſſing brightneſſe. It is further to bée noted that this reaſon which the apoſtle bringeth, is taken from the effect and not from the cauſe. For he dooeth not teach, that wée ſhall bée lyke him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe wée ſhall inioye the ſight of him: but he prooueth that we ſhall therefore bée pertakers of the diuine glorie, becauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our nature were indued with a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, heauenly and an happie immortalitie, it could neuer come ſo néere vnto God. And yet there ſhal not be ſuch a perfection of glory in vs, that our ſight ſhal comprehend God who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For there ſhall be euen then betwéene him and vs, a great diſtance of proportion. But when the Apoſtle ſaith, we ſhall ſée him as he is, he noteth out a new &amp; vnſpeakable kind of ſéeing, wherof we are now ignorant.
<pb facs="tcp:7582:63"/> For ſo long as we walke by faith, <hi>Paule</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that we are ſtraungers from him. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. And ſo often as he yéelded himſelfe to be ſéene of the fathers, he was not ſéene in his being, but vnder certaine markes. There then ſhall the maieſtie of God which now is ſecret, be ſéene at the laſt in it ſelfe, when the vaile of this mortall and corruptible nature ſhall be taken away. I paſſe by other ſubtill reaſonings. For we ſée how <hi>Auguſtine</hi> dooth vexe himſelfe in them, and yet we ſée he doth not ridde himſelfe thereof, both in his Epiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to <hi>Paulina,</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> and alſo in his booke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Citie of God. 22. &amp; in other places. Yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he ſaith there is worth noting, That in this inquiſition the meane of ſéeing is more excellent then of ſpeaking: and that there muſt be héede taken, leaſt while by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending we ſéeke how God can be ſéene, we léeſe the peace and holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſée him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Euery one which hath this hope.</hi> Now he concludeth that therefore the indeauor of holineſſe ought not to waxe colde in vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our felicitie dooth not yet appeare, for that hope ſufficeth. Further we knowe that thoſe things are hoped for, which are hid. The meaning therefore is: Howſoeuer we haue
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7582:63"/> not Chriſt yet preſent before our eyes, if yet we truſt in him, that it cannot be, but this hope will ſtir vs vp, and pricke vs forward to follow after holineſſe: becauſe being right it guideth vs to Chriſt, whom we knowe to be the perfect example of holineſſe.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7582:64"/> For it is verie credible, that there were then ſuch, as by theſe flatterings did extenuate their ſinnes, and make them ſéeme leſſe then they were: It is no maruell if we ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are men: but there is great oddes betwéene ſinne and the breaking of the law. The Apoſtle driueth from them this vayne excuſe, when he defineth ſinne to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the lawe.

                  <p>The name it ſelfe of ſin ſéemeth to ſome to be but a light thing: but iniquitie or tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the lawe, cannot ſo eaſely be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen. But the Apoſtle dooth not make ſins equall, when he condemneth all ſinners of iniquitie, but he laboureth ſimplye to teach, that ſinne ariſeth of the contempt of God, &amp; that by ſinning the righteouſneſſe of the law is broken. Wherefore this doctrine of <hi>Iohn</hi> hath none agréement with that doating Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stoikes, Furthermore to ſinne, in this place doth not ſignifie to offend in ſome work, nor is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of ſin taken for euerye offence: but he calleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſin, when men runne headlong into euil with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole affection of the hart.

Hence it doth not folow nor can it be gathered, that the faithfull are wicked: becauſe they deſire to be ſubiect to God, &amp; they miſlike with themſelues becauſe of their ſins, &amp; that for euery offence. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as much as in them lieth, they frame their liues to the obedience of the law.

                  <p n="7">7 <hi>HE that dooth righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Apoſtle teacheth in this place, that the newneſſe of lyfe muſt be made knowen by good works: and that the lykeneſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7582:66" rendition="simple:additions"/> hée hadde ſpoken, which is betwixt Chriſt and his members can not ſtande, excepte it bring foorth the fruite. As if hée hadde ſayde, Séeing it dooth become vs to bée lyke vnto Chriſt, let the truth &amp; witneſſe of this thing, appeare in our lyfe. This exhortation is all one with that of <hi>Paules,</hi> in the 5. to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> vearſe. 25. If you liue in the Spirite, walke alſo in the Spirite. For many would gladly perſwade themſelues that they haue righteouſneſſe hidde in their hearts, while their féete, their hands, their tongues, &amp; eyes, are let looſe to iniquitie.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Hee that committeth ſinne.</hi> Alſo, this worde to <hi>Commit,</hi> is referred to the outwarde déedes, that the meaning may bée, that there is no lyfe of God and of Chriſt, where men behaue themſelues leawdly and wickedlye, but rather ſuche are the bonde ſlaues of the Diuell. By which ſpeach, he more fully expreſſeth how farre they diſagrée from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For euen as firſt he hadde ſette foorthe Chriſt the Fountaine of all righteouſneſſe: ſo nowe alſo on the contrarye, he aſſigneth the Diuell, to bée the heade of ſinne. Hée denyeth that anye man dooth belonge
<pb facs="tcp:7582:67"/> to Chriſt, but hée that is righteous, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth himſelfe to bée ſuch a one by his workes: now he ſendeth all other into the diuels fellowſhip, and caſteth them vnder his dominion: that we may know that Sathan dooth exerciſe tyrannie, where the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt dooth not beare the ſwaye. And yet there are not to be imagined with the <hi>Maniches</hi> two beginnings one againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for we know that the Diuel is euill not by nature &amp; creation, but by the iniquitie of his owne falling away.</p>
                  <p>We knowe further, that he is not equall with God, that he ſhould contend with him in a like power: but that hée is forced man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his téeth, that hée cannot doo anye thing, except at the will and aſſignment of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour. Finally when <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, Some are borne of God, and ſome are of the Diuell, he faineth no propagation as the <hi>Maniches</hi> did dreame: but he meaneth that the firſt are gouerned by the Spirite of Chriſt: and the others are vyolently carryed of Sathan, as God hath giuen him this power againſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe the Diuell ſinneth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> Euen as before he ſpake not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Chriſtes perſon, when he ſayd, hée was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7582:67" rendition="simple:additions"/> righteous, but didde aſſigne him to bée the cauſe and Fountaine of righteouſneſſe: ſo nowe when hée ſayth the Diuell ſinneth, hée comprehendeth his whole bodie, that is, all reprobates. As if hée had ſayde, this is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells propertie, that he force vnto ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Wherevpon it followeth, that they are his members and are led of him, whoſoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Further, this <hi>Beginning</hi> whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle maketh mention, is not of eternitie: as when he teacheth that the word was from the beginning. For there is great oddes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene God and creatures. The beginning in God is without time. Wherefore, ſéeing the word was euer with God, thou ſhalt not finde any inſtant of time wherin it began to be: but it is of neceſſitie that thou come to very eternitie it ſelfe. And héere <hi>Iohn</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing els, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the diuell was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata, immediatelye after the creation of the worlde, and from thence hath neuer cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſpreade abroade his poyſon amongeſt men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For this purpoſe appeared the Sonne of God.</hi> Hée repeateth the ſame thing againe in other wordes, that hée ſayde before, That Chriſt came to take awaye ſinne. Hence are
<pb facs="tcp:7582:68"/> two things to be gathered: That they can not be accompted for the members of Chriſt, nor anye waye to appertayne to his bodye, in whome ſinne dooth raigne. For whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Chriſt ſheweth his power, he putteth the Diuell and ſinne to flight. Which alſo <hi>Iohn</hi> addeth immediatelye, for the next ſentence, where he ſayeth, That they ſinne not which are borne of God, is the concluſion of thoſe things, that went afore.</p>
                  <p>The Argument is drawen from repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces, as I ſayd before: becauſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, which of neceſſitie bringeth with it righteouſnneſſe, can not ſtande toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſinne. But I haue alredie touched afore, what <hi>Not to ſinne</hi> dooth ſignifie héere. For hée dooth not make the Children of god vtterlye frée from all fault, but hée denyeth that they can trulye boaſte of this title: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as from their heart indeauour them ſelues to frame their life vnto the obedience of God.</p>
                  <p>Indéede the Pelagians and Puritanes did once abuſe this teſtimonie: when they imagined that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull were indued with an Angelicall puritie in this world. And in this time certaine of the Anabaptiſtes haue renued that dotage.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:7582:68"/>
                  <p>But whoſoeuer dreame of ſuch a perfection, doo ſufficiently ſhowe what a blockiſh conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they haue. And theſe wordes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle are ſo farre off from ſtrengthening their errour, that they ſuffice to refute them. He ſayeth, <hi>They ſinne not,</hi> which are borne of God. Nowe reſteth to be ſéene, whether God doo regenerate vs in one moment. But it is manifeſt that regeneration is ſo begun in vs, as the remnaunts of the olde man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne euen vnto death. But if regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not full and perfect, it doth frée vs from the bondage of ſinne, but according to the meaſure thereof. Hence appeareth that it can not be poſſible, but the Children of GOD are burdened with offences, and doo daylye ſinne, inaſmuch as they haue yet ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynder of the olde nature.</p>
                  <p>And yet this remayneth ſure that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayth, That this is the ende of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that ſinne may be done away: and that they therefore lyue iuſtlye and godlye, whoſoeuer are borne of GOD: becauſe the Spirite of GOD dooth correct the deſire of ſinning.</p>
                  <p>And that the Apoſtle meaneth, by the <hi>Seede of GOD.</hi> For ſo the Spirite of
<pb facs="tcp:7582:69"/> God frameth the heartes of the godly vnto right affection, that the fleſh with his luſtes preuayleth not, but is kept vnder, as béeing tamed vnder a yoke. In concluſion, the chiefe effects in the elect, the Apoſtle aſcribeth to the ſpirit of God, who by his power repreſſeth ſinne, and doth not ſuffer it to flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither can he ſinne.</hi> Héere now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle aſcendeth higher. For he doth plainly teſtifie, that the hearts of the godly are ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually gouerned by the ſpirite of God, that they followe his direction with an vnchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable deſire. But this is verie far from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh doctrine. The Sorboniſtes indéede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the will of man cannot deſire that which is right, except it bée holpen by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: but they imagine the motion of the ſpirit to be ſuch, as leaueth vnto vs the frée choice of good &amp; euil. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they draw me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, becauſe we willingly obeye vnto the grace of the ſpirit, which it was in our power to reiect. Finally, they define this to bée the onely grace of the ſpirite, that wée be able to will well, if we liſt. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in this place: for he doth not onely teach that we are able not to ſinne, but that the motion of the ſpirit is ſo effectuall, that of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie it holdeth vs in a continall obedience
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7582:69" rendition="simple:additions"/> of righteouſneſſe. Neither is this the onelye <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore let vs not with the Schoole men imagine ſome middle motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is in a mans choice to followe, or to refuſe: but let vs know that our hearts are gouerned of the ſpirit of God, that they may conſtantlye cleaue to the waie of righteouſneſſe. Further, the abſurditie which the Schoole men obiect, is eaſily refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. They ſaie, but falſly, that by this meanes Will is taken from man. For will is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but becauſe the corruption of nature bringeth foorth onely euill affections, therfore it is of neceſſitie, that the ſpirit of God doe reforme it, whereby it maye incline to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And againe, becauſe men would eaſily fall from that which is good, it is of neceſſitie, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſpirit continue vnto the end, that
<pb facs="tcp:7582:70"/> which he hath begun. The anſwere concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning deſert is eaſie: for it is not to be held for an abſurd thing, if men deſerue nothing: and yet workes ceaſe not to bée accounted good, which procéed from the grace of the ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are voluntarie. They haue alſo reward, becauſe they are fréely accounted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, as if they were their owne. But here ariſeth a queſtion, whether ſo ſoone as anye man is regenerate by the ſpirit of God, god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe &amp; the feare of God can neuer be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in him. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles words ſéeme to giue this.

And moreouer in the 51. Pſalm. 12. he deſireth that it may be reſtored to him again. Whervpon it foloweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was depriued of it. Yet I doubt not, but that ſéede wherewith God doth regenerate his elect, as it is incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, ſo it kéepeth the continuall force.

Wherevpon it followeth, that if wée loue our bretheren, we are happie, and if wée hate them, we are miſerable. Ther is no man that dooth not deſire to eſcape and to be dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from death, therefore they muſt néede be more then blinde, who by foſtering of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred doo willingly pamper their own death. Further, when the apoſtle ſaith, that by loue it is knowen that we haue paſſed into life, he meaneth not that man is his own deliuerer, as if by louing the bretheren hée deliuered himſelfe from death, &amp; obtained life for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For he dooth not diſpute héere of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of ſaluation: but ſéeing loue is the principall fruite of the ſpirite, it is alſo a certaine note of regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Therfore the Apoſtle reaſoneth from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſigne and not from the cauſe. For becauſe no man doth truely loue the brethren, except he which is regenerate by the ſpirit. Hence it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gathered, that the ſpirite of God which is lyfe, dooth dwell in them that loue the brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.

This Argument ſhould haue more coulour, if loue make vs more aſſured of our life: that then the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſaluation doth conſiſt in act. But the anſwere therof is alſo eaſie. For albeit that faith is confirmed by al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces of god, as by helps, yet it ceaſeth not to haue his foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the onely frée mercie of God. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when we inioy the light, we are ſure that the Sunne ſhineth: if the Sunne giue his beams into the place wherin we are, we haue a certaine more cléere ſight: but yet albeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> viſible beames doe not pearce through vnto vs, in this ſame we are ſatiſfied that the Sun yéeldeth out the vſe of his ſhining vnto vs. So after that our fayth is eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, certayne thinges maye come to paſſe, which maye helpe it: yet in the meane time it reſteth in the alone grace of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 <hi>Is a manſlayer.</hi> To the end hée maye ſtirre vs the more vnto loue, he ſheweth how deteſtable a thing before God, hatred is.

And the apoſtle ſheweth that they are al manſlayers which hate theyr bretheren. Hée coulde not ſpeake anie thing more bitterlie,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:74"/> and yet this is not hyperbolical. For who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we hate, we could affoord that he periſhed. And it is no matter, if one kéepe his hands from the euill. For the verie deſire is condempned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as much as is the practiſe. Yea, alſo when we our ſelues do not deſire to do hurt, if yet we deſire that ſome euil may come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our brother from other wher, euen then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we are manſlaiers. Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth define the matter, euen as it is, where he giueth the name of manſlaughter to hatred. Wherby is conuinced the fooliſhneſſe of men, becauſe when they doe euen loath the name, they make almoſt no account of the fault it ſelfe. And whence is that? Euen becauſe the outward face of things doth occupie all our ſences, before God the inwarde affection is regarded. Wherefore leaſt anye doe anye more leſſen ſo excéeding an euill, let vs learne to call backe our iudgements to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment feate of God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 <hi>By this wee knowe.</hi> Now he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is true loue. For it were not inoughe to prayſe it excepte the power of it were knowen. And hée ſetteth forth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule of loue, in the example of Chriſt: becauſe in not ſparing his owne lyfe, hée
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7582:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> made it knowen howe much hée loued vs. Therefore hée biddeth vs labour to this point. The ſumme is, that therein is our loue commended, if wée tranſferre the loue of our ſelues vnto our bretheren: So as euerie one after a ſorte forgetting himſelfe, take care for others. It is indéede moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that wée are not farre vnlyke vnto Chriſt, but the Apoſtle doeth commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs imitation, becauſe albeit we attain not vnto him, yet it is good that wée followe his ſteppes a farre off. Indéede when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle giueth counſaile to hypocrites, that they caſt awaye vaine boaſting, which bragge that they haue the fayth of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brotherlye loue, hée doeth ſhewe, that excepte this deſire doeth preuayle in our heartes, wée haue nothing to doe with Chriſt. Neyther yet as I ſayde doeth hée ſo ſet before vs the loue of Chriſt, that hée requireth an equall loue of vs. For what ſhoulde that bée elſe but a driuing of all at once to deſperation? But ſo he will haue our affections framed, that wée maye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to beſtowe both our life and death, firſt to the glorie of God, and then to the good of our neighbour.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7582:75"/>
                  <p>There is another difference betwixt vs and Chriſt, that there cannot bée the ſame power of our death For neither is the wrath of God pacified by our bloud, nor lyfe attayned vnto by our death, nor the debt of others is paide. But the Apoſtle by this compariſon, did not reſpect what was the end or effect of the death of Chriſt, but he onelye woulde that our lyfe ſhould be conformed to his example.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 <hi>If anie haue this worlds good.</hi> Nowe he preacheth of the common offices of loue, which procéed from that chiefe fountaine: that is, when we are prepared to reache out our ſelues euen vnto death for our brethren. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſéemeth to reaſon from the more to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſe. For he that refuſeth to eaſe the want of his brother with his good, while his life is not touched, much leſſe will he beſtowe his lyfe. Therefore hée denyeth that there is loue in vs, if we leaue our bretheren deſtitute of our helpe. But he accompteth ſo highly of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall liberalitie, that together he ſheweth moſt fitly what is the true way to do well, &amp; what kinde of affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to guide the ſame. Let therfore this be the firſt propoſition: That no man doth truly loue the brethren, but hée wil ſhew forth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in effect, as oft as occaſion doth require. Another, how much riches anie

It followeth therfore that faith is ſubuerted with the diſquiet of an euill conſcience. He calleth, <hi>God greater then our heart,</hi> in reſpect of iudgement, that is, becauſe he ſéeth much more cléerelye then we, and ſearcheth more ſharpe, and iudgeth more ſtraightly. In which ſenſe <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, that albeit he knewe nothing by himſelf, yet he was not thereby iuſtified. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. For he acknowledgeth, that albeit he be carefully giuen vnto his dutie, yet that he offendeth in many things, and that he dooth forgiue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by vnaduiſedneſſe, thoſe ſinnes which God dooth ſée. This therefore is the minde of the Apoſtle, that it cannot be that he ſhoulde eſcape the iudgement of God, whom his own conſcience dooth accuſe and conuince. To the ſame ende belongeth that he by and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth, that God ſéeth all things. For howe ſhould thoſe things be ſecret, which wée are driuen to ſée, who in reſpect of him are block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7582:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> and blinde? So therefore expound it, God in that he ſéeth all things, is much greater then our heart. For to take the word y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth together in ſtéed of a perticular cauſall is not ſtraunge. Now the ſenſe is plain, that is, that ſéeing the knowledge of God pearceth further then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenſe of our owne conſcience, that no man can ſtand before him, excepte hée whom vprightneſſe of conſcience ſuſtaineth. But héere is obiected a queſtion: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the reprobate are ſometime drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Satan in ſuch a Lake of féeling, that they féele not their euills at all, and without all griefe or feare, as <hi>Paule</hi> ſaith, they runne ſecurely into their deſtruction. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.19. And it is certaine alſo that hypocrites are wont to flatter themſelues, and proudly to contemne the iudgement of God, becauſe that béeing dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with a falſe opinion of righteouſnes, they are not touched with their ſinnes. The aunſwere is eaſie, That hypocrites are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued becauſe they ſhun the light: and that the reprobates feele nothing, becauſe they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from God. Yea, there is no ſecuritie to an euill conſcience, but in lurking corners. But héere the Apoſtle ſpeketh of conſciences, which being brought out into light, GOD bringeth to his tribunall ſeate, and exerciſeth
<pb facs="tcp:7582:78"/> with the féeling of his iudgement. Albeit yet this is alſo generally true: that we neuer haue any ſound peace, except that which the ſpirite of God dooth giue vnto pure heartes thoſe whome we haue ſayd to be aſtoniſhed, féele yet oftetinmes blind prickings, and are tormented in their drouſineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 <hi>If our heart accuſe vs not.</hi> I haue expounded alreadie, that this dooth neither belong to hypocriſie, nor to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> groſe contempt of God.

This exqueſite ballaunce of GOD cauſeth by his triall, that none canne boaſt himſelfe that hée hath a cleane heart. Therefore the Apoſtles words hath this meaning, that then we come onely with a quiet conſcience into the ſight of God, when béeing of a ſound purpoſe in our ſelues, wée bring with vs the witneſſe of a ryght and good heart. That ſaying of <hi>Paule</hi> is indéede true: That we haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce to GOD with boldneſſe by faith, which reſteth vppon the grace of GOD. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12.

For <hi>Paule</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe of boldneſſe: but <hi>Iohn</hi> onelye maketh mention of an inſeparable accident, which is neceſſarily anexed, though it bée not the cauſe. Yet héere ariſeth a greater hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe there ſéemeth no aſſuraunce to be left in the whole worlde. For who is there to bée founde whome his heart cannot accuſe in anie thing? I aunſwere, that the godlye are ſo reproued, as they together doe eaſe themſelues: for it is indéede neceſſarye, that they ſhoulde inwardly be touched effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually with their ſinnes, that feare maye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them to humilitie: but by and by they flye to the ſacrifice of Chriſt, where they haue aſſured peace. Albeit the Apoſtle doeth ſaye that they are not accuſed in anie other ſence, becauſe howſoeuer they acknowledge themſelues to fayle in many things, yet they are releeued with this teſtimonie of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe they doe truelye and from the heart feare God, and deſire to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to his righteouſneſſe. Whoſoeuer are indued with this godly deſire, &amp; in the meane time knowe that theyr indeauours, howe much ſo euer they want of perfection, doe yet pleaſe GOD: are worthely ſayde to haue a
<pb facs="tcp:7582:79"/> quiet and peaceable heart: becauſe there is no inward pricking, which ſhould diſturbe their quiet chéerefulneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 <hi>And if we ſhall aske any thing.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe aſſured truſt and calling vpon God are things ioyned together: euen as before he had taught that an euill conſcience was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to aſſurance: ſo now he ſheweth, that god cannot be called vppon, but of them which feare him and worſhip him a right in a pure heart. This latter foloweth of the firſt. Ther is another generall principle of Scripture, That the wicked are not heard of God, but rather that there ſacrifices and prayers are abhominable. Therfore the way is héere ſhut vp againſt hipocrites, leaſt they ſhould ruſh into the preſence of God with his contempt.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time he dooth not intende that a good conſcience muſt be brought, as if it did great acceptation to our praiers.

                  <p>They therefore were called Spirites, which onely giuing their tongues to the Oracles of the holy Ghoſt, did after a ſort beare the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his miniſterie: they ſet foorth nothing of their owne deuiſing, nor came they forth in their owne name.</p>
                  <p>And héeretoo belongeth ſo honourable a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, leaſt any thing might faile of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:7582:84"/> of the worde of God, for the contempt of the miniſter. For God alwaies wold haue his word receiued from the mouth of men, no other waies, then if he himſelfe had plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared from heauen.</p>
                  <p>Héere Sathan hath crept in as a meane: and when he fained in falſe teachers to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God alſo gaue them a name vnder which, they might the better deceiue. So the falſe Prophets vſed alwayes proudly and with ful mouth to arrogate to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues whatſoeuer honour God had beſtowed vpon his ſeruants. And the apoſtle ſéemeth to haue vſed this name, leaſt they might deceiue vs with their falſe pretences, which falſlye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende the name of God: euen as we ſée at this daye very many to be amazed with the bare name of the church, that they had rather auowe themſelues into the eternall deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope, then to take from him any or the leaſt part of authoritie.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this graunting is to be noted. For the Apoſtle coulde haue ſayde, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one is not to bée beléeued: but becauſe falſe teachers did ſo belye the title of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, he ſo leaueth the ſame vnto them, that together hée ſheweth that it is friuolous and triflyng, excepte they doo indéede perfourme
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7582:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> what they pretende, and that they are to be accounted as fooles, who being amazed at the very noyſe of an honourable title, dare not inquire of the matter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Prooue the Spirites.</hi> Becauſe all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be not true, the Apoſtle ſayth héere that they muſt be brought to the trial. And he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not only to the whole body of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church: but alſo to euery faythfull man. But it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whence we haue ſuch a diſcretion? They which aunſwere, that the worde of God is a rule whereby euerye thing muſt bée tryed, which men doo publikely ſet foorth, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaye nothing nor the whole. I graunt that doctrines are to be proued by the worde of God: but except the ſpirit of wiſedome be preſent, it will lyttle or nothing profitte to haue the worde of God at hande, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation we ſhall not knowe. Euen as, for example, golde is tryed in the fire, and with the touch ſtone: but of them that haue ſkill. For vnto the vnſkilfull, neyther the touchſtone nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire can be profitable. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may be fit iudges, it is néedfull that we be indued with the ſpirite of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And becauſe the Apoſtle ſhoulde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vs this in vayne, except we had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to diſcern, it is for a certaintie to be held
<pb facs="tcp:7582:85"/> that the godly ſhall neuer be deſtitute of the ſpirite of wiſedome, ſo farre as ſhall be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, ſo that they aſke it of the Lord. But ſo then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite ſhal lead vs to a true diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if we ſubmit all our ſenſes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word. For it is (as is ſayd) like vnto a touchſtone: yea, it ought to be of much more price vnto vs: becauſe that onely is true doctrine which is taken from thence. But héere ariſeth a hard queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe if euery one haue right and abilitie to diſcerne, there can neuer any certaintie be determined: but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſtate of Religion ſhall be vncertaine. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that there is a double triall of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, priuate and publyke. Priuate, wherby euery one dooth eſtabliſh his owne faith, that he may reſt ſafely in that doctrine, which hée knoweth to haue come from God. Neither ſhall conſciences finde other where ſafe and quiet reſting place then in God.</p>
                  <p>The publyke tryall belongeth to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent and good of the Church. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is perill leaſt phantaſticall men ſhuld riſe vp, which might raſhly boaſt them ſelues, that they wer indued with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God: this remedie is of neceſſitie, that the faithfull come together, and ſéeke the meane of an holy and pure conſent.</p>

Nor yet ſo ſoone as an hundred or moe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are come together into one certayne place, it by and by followeth that they haue rightly called vpon God, and aſked at his mouth what was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: yea, ther is nothing more apparaunt, then that they haue often gone a ſide from the ſincere worde of God. Therefore héere alſo ought the triall which the Apoſtle preſcribeth to be of force, that the ſpirits might be tried.</p>

Therefore ſo long as wée remaine in Chriſt, the matter is ſafe: but when we goe aſide from him, faith is pery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and all truth is made voyde. But, wée may remember what this confeſſion contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.

                  <p>Finally, when hée ſayth hée is come, wée muſt conſider the cauſe of his comming: for hée is not ſent of his Father in vaine.

If wée in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for one day, yet a doubtfulneſſe créepeth vpon our minds, what ſhall come to paſſe to morrowe: and ſo we are alwaies doubtfull. The Apoſtle therefore ſheweth that wée are ſtrong, not in our owne ſtrength, but in the power of God. Whervpon he gathereth, that we can no more be vanquiſhed, then god him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who hath armed vs to the ende of the world with his owne power. And in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall warrefare this cogitation muſt bée ſetled in our hearts, that we ſhould vtterlye be vndone, if we ſhoulde fight in our owne ſtrength.

                  <p n="5">5 <hi>They are of the worlde.</hi> This is no ſmall comfort, that they which dare incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with God in vs, are onely ſtrengthened with worldly helpes. Further, the Apoſtle vnderſtandeth the worlde, as Sathan is the Prince of it. Together is added another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when he ſaith, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world imbraceth in falſe Prophets, that which it doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for their own. We ſée how great y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of man is to vanitie. Therefore falſe doctrines eaſilye enter by and by, and ſpread farre and wide. The Apoſtle denyeth that there is cauſe why wée ſhoulde therefore bée troubled: becauſe there is nothing newe or vnwonted, if the world which is whole a lier, doe willingly heare a lie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Wee are of GOD.</hi> Albeit this agréeth vnto all the godly: yet properlye it belongeth to the true and faithfull miniſters of the Goſpell. For the Apoſtle by the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce of the Spirit reioyceth, that hée and his fellowes doe ſincerely ſerue GOD, and that they haue receyued of him whatſoeuer they deliuer. It maye alſo bée that the falſe Apoſtles maye boaſt themſelues of the ſame, (as it is theyr manner vnder a maſking vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, as it were of GOD, to deceyue:)
<pb facs="tcp:7582:89"/> but faithfull teachers differ much from them which ſpeake nothing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in words, that they doe not performe in déede. Yet wée muſt alwayes reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber what cauſe he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth héere. There was a ſmall number of the godly: &amp; vnbeléefe almoſt poſſeſſed all things: few did truely cleane to the Goſpell: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part was prone to errour. Hence came the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of offence: which that <hi>Iohn</hi> might méete withall, he biddeth vs be contented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fewneſſe of the faithfull: becauſe all the children of God doe giue honour to him, and ſubmit themſelues to his doctrine. For the contrarie member he oppoſeth immediatlye after, that <hi>They which</hi> are not of God, heare not the pure doctrine of the goſpell. By which words he ſignifieth, that that great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to whome the Goſpell taſteth not, dooe not therefore heare the approued and lawful ſeruaunts of God, becauſe it is a ſtranger to God himſelfe: and that therefore nothing is diminiſhed from the authoritie of the Goſpel, while it is reiected of many. But to this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is anexed a profitable admonition, that by the obedience of faith we proue our ſelues to be of God: There is nothing more eaſie, then to boaſt that we are of God: and therfore there is nothing amongſt men more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7582:89"/> As the Papiſts at this daie do proudly boaſt that they are the worſhippers of God: and in the meane time they doo no leſſe proudly caſt aſide the word of God. For albeit they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait that they beléeue the word of God: yet when it comes to the point, they haue theyr eares ſhut. But this is the onely teſtimonie of the feare of God, to reuerence his worde. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excuſe which many vſe to prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d hath héere no place. That they therefore flye from the doctrine of the goſpell, when it is ſet forth vnto them, becauſe they are not able to iudge.

I anſwere, that at that time they are not in our iudgement, to bée taken for GODS children. But, this is a marke of one that is a reprobate, when hée doeth obſtinatly reiect the truth.

<pb facs="tcp:7582:90"/> this,</hi> contayneth the two members afore, as it hée ſhould ſaye, that thereby truth is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from falſehoode, becauſe ſome ſpeake from God, ſome of the worlde. And whereas by the Spirit of truth and errour, ſome thinke that the hearers are noted: as if he ſhoulde ſaie, that they which giue themſelues to bée ſeduced of the deceiuers, are borne to errour, and haue in them the ſéede of lying: and that they which conſent vnto the worde of GOD, are ſhewed by this teſtimonie to be true: I doe not allowe of it. For when the Apoſtle héere taketh a <hi>Metonimia</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> for the teachers and Prophettes, I take it that he meaneth nothing elſe, then that the tryall of the Doctrine is to bée reduced to theſe two, whether it bée of God, or of the worlde. Yet in ſo ſpeaking hée ſéemes to ſay nothing. For it will bée eaſie for euerye one to except, that hée ſpeaketh not but from God. So at this daye, the Papiſtes boaſt with an emperiall pride, that all their deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are the Oracles of the Spirite. Nor ſo much as <hi>Mahomet</hi> but hée giueth out that hée receiued his dotages from no other wher, but from Heauen. And alſo the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> forged, that thoſe ſtinking dotages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they beſotted themſelues and others,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7582:90" rendition="simple:additions"/> were reuealed vnto them from Heauen. But I anſwere, that we haue the worde of God, which before all things we muſt aſke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel at. Therefore when deceiuable Spirites pretend the name of God, it is good to ſearch by the Scriptures, whether the matter be ſo or not. So that we adde a godly indeauour with humilitie and modeſtie: the Spirit of diſcreation will bée preſent, which maye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound himſelfe ſpeaking in the Scriptures, as a faythfull interpreter.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7582:91"/> and exhortation to loue. Hée ſo continueth in two heads, that from one he goeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatlye to the other. When he commendeth mutuall loue, he doeth not meane that wée haue done al our dutie if we loue our friends againe, becauſe they loue vs? But becauſe he ſpeaketh in common to the faithful, he might not ſpeake other wayes, then that they might loue one another. He confirmeth this ſentence by a reaſon aleadged ſometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie: that is, becauſe no man ſhall approue himſelfe to be the childe of GOD, except hée which loueth his bretheren: and becauſe the true knowledge of God worketh in vs of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie the loue of God. Hée oppoſeth alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his manner the contrarie member, That there is no knowledge of God where loue is not in his ſtrength. And hée taketh a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall principle, becauſe God is loue: that is, becauſe his nature is to loue men. I knowe that manye doe ſubtillye playe the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: and eſpecially that the olde writers haue abuſed this place, that they might proue the Godhead of the Spirit. But the ſimple meaning of the Apoſtle is: Becauſe God is the fountaine of loue, that this affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion floweth and is powred out from him, whereſoeuer his knowledge commeth.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:7582:91"/>
                  <p>Lyke as before hée called him lyght, becauſe there is nothing darke in him, but rather hée lyghteneth all with his brightneſſe. Hée ſpeaketh not therefore héere of the béeing of GOD: but onelye ſheweth what a one hée is to bée perceyued of vs. But, there are two thinges to be noted in theſe wordes of the Apoſtle, that this is the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD, which doeth regenerate vs and frame vs a newe, that wée maye become newe creatures: then that it cannot bée, but that it make vs conformable to GOD. Let goe therefore that fooliſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of faith vnformed: becauſe if anye man ſeparate faith from loue, he doeth euen as if one ſhould goe about to take heate from the Sunne.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>In this hath appeared.</hi> By manye other witneſſes alſo wée haue the loue of GOD towardes vs approoued. For if it ſhoulde bée aſked why the worlde was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, why wée are placed in it to holde the Lordſhippe of the Earth, why wée are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in this lyfe, that wée maye inioye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and innumerable bleſſinges, why wée are created to the hope of a better lyfe, why wée are indued with light and vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? there canne bée ſhewed no other cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:7582:92"/> of all theſe, then the frée loue of GOD to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes vs. But the Apoſtle chooſeth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall witneſſe in this place, and that which farre excelleth all others. For this loue of God was not onely infinite, that hée ſpared not his owne ſon, that by his death he might reſtore vs to lyfe: but the goodneſſe is more then meruailous, which ought to rauiſh our mindes with admiration. Chriſt therefore is ſuch an excellent and ſingular agréement of the loue of God towards vs, that ſo oft as we behold him, he doeth plainelye confirme this doctrine vnto vs, that God is loue. That he calleth him <hi>Onely begotten,</hi> it ſerueth to amplification. For in that he ſheweth more cléerely, howe entirely he loued vs, in that he gaue his onely ſonne to death for our ſake. In the meane time hée that is one ſonne by nature, maketh manye by adoption and grace: Euen whome ſo euer hée grafteth into his bodye by fayth. Hée ſheweth the ende why Chriſt was ſent of his Father, that wée might liue in him. For without him wée are all dead. But at his comming, he brought lyfe vnto vs. And except our own vnbeléefe doe hinder, we féele this effect of his grace in our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 <hi>In this is loue.</hi> Hée ſetteth forth the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7582:92"/> loue of God more largely by another reaſon: that is, becauſe hée gaue his ſonne for vs, what time wée were enimyes: as <hi>Paule</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. But hée vſeth other wordes, that GOD béeing prouoked by no loue of men, hath loued them freelye of his owne accorde. By which wordes hée meant to teach, that the loue of God towardes vs was without deſeruing Albeit the meaning of the Apoſtle is to ſet God before vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: yet the doctrine of faith is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, which hée ioyneth together. God hath loued vs fréely, why? becauſe we wer ſinners or euer wée were borne: then becauſe in this corruption of our nature we haue an heart that is tourned from him, and is not inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to right and holy affections. If the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie of the Papiſtes ſhoulde haue place, that euerye one is elected of GOD ſo farre as he foreſéeth him worthye of loue: this Doctrine ſhoulde not ſtande, That hée lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs firſt. For then our loue towardes GOD ſhoulde haue the firſt place by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, although that it ſhoulde bée the laſt in time. But the Apoſtle doeth take a graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rule of the holye Scripture, which theſe prophane Sophiſters doe not knowe, that wée are borne ſo wicked and corrupted,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:93"/> that then is as it were bred in vs an hatred of god, that we deſire nothing but that which doth diſpleaſe him, that euery affection of our fleſh doth holde continuall warre with his righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And hee ſent his ſonne.</hi> Therefore Chriſt with all his benefites is proceeded vnto vs, from the alone goodneſſe of God, as from a fountaine. And as it is néedfull for vs to knowe this, that therefore we haue ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt, becauſe our heauenlye Father hath loued vs of his own accord: ſo when we are to ſéeke the ſound and full aſſuraunce of the loue of God towards vs, it is conuenient that we looke no where but vpon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore they dote to their owne deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſoeuer paſſing by Chriſt, doe ſeeke what is determined of them in the ſecrete counſaile of God. Further, he ſheweth again the cauſe of the comming of Chriſt, and his office, when he ſheweth that he was ſent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he might be a propitiation for our ſinnes. And indéede we are firſt taught by theſe wordes, that we were all ſtraungers from God by ſinne, and that this ſeparation remaineth, vntil Chriſt come in betwixt, who may reconcile vs. Secondly, we are taught, that this is the beginning of our lyfe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7582:93"/> that God being pacified by the death of his ſon, receiueth vs to fauour. For in that that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he is called <hi>A reconciler,</hi> this properly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the ſacrifice of his death. We perceiue then, that this belongeth onely to Chriſt, that he put away the ſinnes of the world, and ſo take away the hatred that was betwixt vs and God. But héere may ariſe ſome ſhew of contrarietie. For if God did loue vs before that Chriſt did offer himſelfe to death for vs, what néede was there of a newe reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? So the death of Chriſt might ſéeme ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous. I aunſwere, when Chriſt is ſayd to reconcile his Father to vs, that this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to our capacitie. For as we are guyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euill in our ſelues, we cannot conceiue God but to be angrie and deadlye diſpleaſed, vntill Chriſt aboliſh ſinne by his death, vntil he deliuer vs with the price of his bloud from death. Againe the loue of God requireth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. Therefore, that we may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that we are beloued, it is of neceſſitie that we come to Chriſt, in whom onely wée finde righteouſneſſe. Now we ſée the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſpeaking, which is vſual in Scripture, according to diuers reſpects, that it is apte and moſt fitly profitable to faith.</p>
                  <p>God did therefore put his ſonne betwixt,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:94"/> to reconcile himſelf vnto vs, becauſe he loued vs: but that loue was hidde, becauſe in the meane time we were enimies to God, dayly prouoking his indignation. Then the feare and terrour of an euill conſcience, didde take from vs all taſte of lyfe. Therefore inaſmuch as pertaineth to the féeling of our faith, God beginneth to loue vs in Chriſt. And albeit the Apoſtle doo héere intreat of the firſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, yet let vs knowe, that this is the perpetuall benefite of Chriſt, that by putting away our ſinnes, he might make God at one with vs. And this the Papiſts alſo in ſome parte doo graunt: but afterwards they leſſen this grace, and almoſt bring it to nothing, in bringing in fayned ſatiſfactions. But if men redéeme themſelues with the price of works, then Chriſt ſhall not be an onely reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he is called héere.</p>

                  <p>And faith and confeſſion, are put without difference in the ſame ſenſe.

Therefore in the firſt place he ſheweth vpon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7582:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> what conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath imbraced vs in loue: and how in effect we inioye this grace which he hath giuen vs in Chriſt. Therefore the loue of god towards vs is héere to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. He ſaith it is <hi>Perfect,</hi> becauſe it is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out in full meaſure, and perfourmed ſo throughlye, as if it were abſolute on all partes. But he affirmeth that there are none pertakers of this good, except ſuch as béeing conformable vnto God, doo approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be his Children. The argument therefore is of thoſe things, which be ioyned together.</p>

For ſéeing he is the Iudge of the world, and our ſinnes doo preſſe vs with guiltineſſe, it is of neceſſitie, that together with God, death and hell come into our minde. Hence is the feare which I ſpake off, that men flye from God, as much as lyeth in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> denieth that the faithfull are afraid, when there is mention made to them of the
<pb facs="tcp:7582:98"/> laſt iudgement: but rather to come bold and chéerefull to the iudgement ſeate of God: becauſe they are aſſuredly perſwaded of his fatherly loue. Therefore, ſo much hath eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one profited in the faith, as he is rightlye prepared in minde to waite for the daye of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As he is.</hi> By theſe wordes as I ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, he dooth meane agayne, that this is requyred of vs, that we reſemble the image of God. Such therefore as God is in heuen, ſuch dooth he commaunde vs to bée in this worlde, that we may be accompted his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For the image of God, when it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in vs, it is as a ſeale of his adoption. But ſo hée ſéemeth to place parte of our truſt in workes. Therefore héere the Papiſts doo ſtroute themſelues, as if <hi>Iohn</hi> denyed that truſt, to haue an aſſured confidence of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the alone grace of God, except works did helpe together. But they are deceiued in that, that they weigh not that the Apoſtle dooth not héere fetch his Argument from the cauſe: but the place is of things ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>And wée willinglys confeſſe, that no man is reconciled to God by Chriſt, excepte
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7582:98"/> together hée be reformed and made agréeable to the Image of God: and that they are ſo conformable, that they cannot bée ſeperated the one from the other. The Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſayth this moſt fitlye, for he dooth driue all them from the aſſuraunce of Grace, in whome there is not ſéene any lykeneſſe of God. For it is moſt certayne that ſuche are vtterly ſtraungers to the Spirite of GOD, and to his ſonne Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Neyther alſo doo we denye, that the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of lyfe auayleth to the confirmation of an aſſuraunce: but that I may ſpeake ſo, that it be taken as a ſeconde helpe. But in the meane time it behooueth vs to bée grounded vpon onely grace. Neyther indéede other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhoulde <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine agrée with it ſelfe. For common experience dooth ſhewe, and the Papiſtes themſelues are conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to graunt, that there is alwayes a cauſe of fearfulneſſe in the reſpect of workes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore no man ſhal euer come with a quyet and perſwaded minde to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of GOD, excepte hée deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine firſt with himſelfe, and willynglye confeſſe that hée is of him euen freelye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7582:99"/>
                  <p>But there is no cauſe that any man ſhoulde meruaile, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papiſts taſte none of theſe things, ſéeing the miſerable men knowe no faith, but that which is full of doubting. And further, that hypocriſie dooth ouer ſpred them with darkneſſe, leaſt they ſhould earneſtlye bethinke, how fearfull is the Iudgement of God, where Chriſt is not preſent a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. Others paſſe by the reſurrection, as if it were a tale: but that we may goe foorthe glad and chéereful to méete Chriſt, it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe vs to haue our faith fixed in his grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 <hi>There is no feare.</hi> Now by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries he commendeth the excellencie of that good: for he ſaith, that we are continuallye tormented, vntill God doo deliuer vs from that miſerable torment, with the remedye of his loue towards vs. The effect is, ſéeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more miſerable, than to be vexed with continuall diſquiet, that we attain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this loue of God towardes vs being kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, that we maye quietlye reſt without feare. Whence appeareth, how ſingular a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite it is, that God dooth vouchſafe vs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his loue.</p>
                  <p>Further, of this doctrine he will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately raiſe an exhortation. But before hée
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7582:99"/> exhort vs to our dutie, he commendeth this guifte of God to vs, which by faith taketh feare from vs. I knowe that all this place is other waies expounded of many: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect what the Apoſtle meaneth, not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke. They ſaye, That there is no feare in loue: becauſe when of our owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord we loue God, we are not conſtrained to his obedience by force and feare. Therefore, according to them, a ſeruile feare is héere op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a voluntarie reuerence. Whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is riſen the diſtinction of ſeruile &amp; childly feare. I grant indéed that that is true, when we willyngly loue God as a Father, that we are no more vrged with the feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: but that doctrine hath no agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with this place. For the Apoſtle dooeth onely teach, that when the loue of God is perceiued and knowen vnto vs by Faith, peace is giuen vnto our conſciences, leaſte they be any more diſquieted.</p>
                  <p>Yet it maye be aſked, when perfect Loue caſteth out feare: becauſe being indued with ſome taſte onely of the loue of God towards vs, we are neuer altogether delyuered from feare. I aunſwere: that albeit that feare is not perfectly done awaye, yet when we flye vnto God, as vnto a quyet hauen, ſafe and

                     </gap>e is truly done awaye, becauſe it giueth place to Faith. Therefore feare is not ſo caſt out, but that it dooth mooue our mindes: but it is ſo caſt out, that it maye not moleſt nor hinder our peace, which we perfectly obtaine by Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Feare hath painfulneſſe.</hi> Héere alſo the Apoſtle dooth ſet out the greatneſſe of the grace whereof he ſpeaketh. For ſéeing it is almoſt miſerable condition to ſuffer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all torments, there is nothing more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, then with a quiet conſcience &amp; peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able minde, to preſent himſelfe into the ſight of God. Where others ſaye, that ſeruants feare, becauſe they ſet before their eyes, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and ſcourges, and doo not theyr dutie but conſtrained, it is nothing to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles meaning, as is ſayde alreadye.

                  <p>Which dooth not agrée with the text. For the Apoſtle dooth rather teach, that this is a miſtruſt, wheras a man fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For ſéeing we loue God as the Father and Lord, it cannot be but that reuerence bée ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with loue. Further, God cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from himſelfe. Therefore ſéeing hée is the fountaine of all iuſtice and vprightneſſe: it is neceſſarie that he which loueth him, doe frame all his affections to the obedience of righteouſneſſe. Therefore the loue of God is no idle thing. But we gather alſo out of this
<pb facs="tcp:7582:104"/> place, what is the true obſeruation of the lawe. For if we obeye God in kéeping his commaundementes, inforced onely by feare, we are far of from true obedience. Therefore this is firſt, that our harts do auow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto God in a frée reuerence: and then let the life bée framed vnto the rule of the Lawe. This is the meaning of <hi>Moſes, Deu.</hi> 10.12. When in gathering the ſumme of the lawe, hée ſayth: <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what doeth the Lorde thy God require of thée, but that thou loue him, and obey him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>His commaundements are not gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous.</hi> This is added, leaſt the hardneſſe (as it commeth to paſſe) doe diſable or diminiſh our indeauour. For they which enter a godly and holye life with a chéerefull minde, and great zeale, and after hauing experience of their owne inabilitie, doe waxe ſlowe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iohn</hi> that he maye ſtirre vp our indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, denieth that the commaundements of God are gréeuous. But it may be obiected on the contrary, that we haue experience of a far other thing: and the Scripture doth alſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the yoke of the lawe is not to bée borne. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. The reaſon alſo is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. For ſéeing the denying of our ſelues, is as it were an entraunce to kéepe the Lawe,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7582:104"/> ſhal we ſay that it is an eaſie thing for a man to deny himſelfe? Yea rather, for as much as the lawe is ſpirituall, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. &amp; we are nothing but fleſh, there muſt needs be a great ſtrife betwixt vs &amp; the lawe of God. I anſwere: that this hardneſſe is not of the nature of the Lawe, but of the fault of our faith, which <hi>Paule</hi> alſo plainelye expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: becauſe after that he ſayd that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the law to giue vs righteouſnes, he by and by layeth the fault vpon the fleſh. This anſwere doth very wel reconcile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> which in ſhew doe ſéeme much to differ. <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the lawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſter of death he ſaith it worketh nothing but the wrath of God. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſinne might increaſe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. that it liueth that it may ſlaie vs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10. and 13. <hi>Dauid</hi> contrarily ſaith, that it is ſwéeter vnto him then honnie, and more to bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired then golde. Pſalme. 19.9. Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther praiſes thereof, hée ſetteth theſe, that it chéereth the heartes, it conuerteth vnto the Lorde, and quickneth. But <hi>Paule</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the law with the corrupt nature of man. Hence is that greate conflict. But <hi>Dauid</hi> teacheth, howe they are affected whome God hath begotten agayne with his Spirite.
<pb facs="tcp:7582:105"/> Hence is that ſwéetneſſe and delight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fleſh taſteth not. Neither truely hath <hi>Iohn</hi> ouerpaſſed this diſtinction. For leaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhould take this generally, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God are not gréeuous, hée reſtraineth it to the children of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſignifieth, that this is brought to paſſe by the power of the ſpirit, that it is not grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto vs nor troubleſome to obey God. Yet the queſtion ſéemeth not as yet to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together anſwered. For the faithfull howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be gouerned by the ſpirit of God, yet they abide a hard co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bat with their fleſh: and although they ſweate, yet they ſcarce frame themſelues vnto theyr duetie by the halfe part. Yea, rather being ſet, as it were betwéene the ſacrifice &amp; the alter (as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is) they doe almoſt faint vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. We doe ſée how that <hi>Paule</hi> doeth ſigh, that he is holden priſoner, and doth crie out that he is vnhappie, becauſe he cannot ſerue God fréely. I aunſwere, that the lawe is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eaſie, foraſmuch as being indued with he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye vertue, we doe ouercome the deſires of the fleſh. For howſoeuer the fleſh doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, yet the faithfull doe féele that they are delighted ſo much in no other thing, as that they maye followe God.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:7582:105"/>
                  <p>Moreouer, it is to be noted, that <hi>Iohn</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſpeake of the bare law which contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing beſides the commaundements: but that he ioyneth with all the fatherlye kindneſſe of God, whereby the rigour of the lawe is mittigated. Therefore ſéeing wée knowe that wée are mercifullye pardoned of the Lorde, if our workes doe not ſatiſfie the lawe, that doth make vs a greate deale rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer vnto obedience, as it is in Pſalme. 130.4. There is mercie with thée that thou maiſt bée feared. Hence then is the eaſineſſe of the kéeping the Lawe, that the faithfull ſtaide vp by forgiueneſſe, if in anye point they faile, doe not deſpaire. In the meane time the Apoſtle warneth vs, that wée muſt ſtriue that wée may ſerue the Lord. For the whole worlde doeth ſtande agaynſt vs, leaſt wée ſhoulde goe forwarde whether God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs. Therefore hée in effect ſhall kéepe the Lawe, which ſhall ſtronglye reſiſt the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>This is the victorie.</hi> Becauſe hée ſayd that all they which are borne of God doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome the worlde.

<pb facs="tcp:7582:106"/> in faith. An excellent place: becauſe although Sathan doe dayly giue harde and fearefull aſſaultes: the ſpirite of God pronouncing that we are without daunger, doeth encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vs to ſtriue ſtoutly, ſéeing feare is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken awaie. And the time paſt is of more force, then the preſent, or the time to come. For he ſaith that he hath ouercome, that wée may bée euen ſo aſſured as though the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie were now put to flight. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, that our warrefare laſteth all our lyfe, that wee haue daylye conflictes, yea, that wée haue euerie moment newe and ſundrie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails on euerie ſide w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the enimie, but becauſe God doth not arme vs onely for one day, and faith alſo is not for one daye, but a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all worke of the holy Ghoſt. Wée are nowe no other wayes conquerours, then if wée had giuen the ouerthrow in the battaile. Neither yet doeth this truſt bring retchleſneſſe, but that we bée alwayes carefully bent vnto the battaile. For the Lord biddeth his to be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſuch ſort, that yet he wil not haue them careleſſe. Yea rather, he doeth therefore ſaye, that they haue ouercome, to the intent that they might fight the more couragiouſly and more ſtoutly. The name of the world is héere taken largely, for it comprehendeth whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7582:106"/> is contrarie to the ſpirite of God. So the wickedneſſe of our nature is parte of the world, all luſts, all the ſleightes of Sathan, and finally, whatſoeuer doeth drawe vs from God. In ſo plentifull a band of men, a great waight of the battaile lyeth vpon vs: and we ſhould euen nowe before the conflict be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and daily to be ouercommed an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth times, but that God did promiſe vs the victorie. But GOD on this condition doeth exhort vs to the conflicte, that firſt hée promiſeth the victorie. But as this promiſe doth arme vs continuallye with the inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power of God: ſo on the contrarie parte, it bringeth to nothing the ſtrength of men. Neither indeed doth the Apoſtle héere teach, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God doth onely helpe vs, that being aided by his help, we may be able to reſiſt: but he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the victorie in faith onely.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the compariſon hath this purpoſe, not onely that we doe knowe, that the lawe of <hi>Moſes</hi> is done awaie by the comming of Chriſt. But that we ſhould ſéeke in him the fulfilling of thoſe thinges which the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in times paſt did ſignifie. And although there were manye figures, yet the Apoſtle doeth note vnder theſe two the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of holyneſſe and ryghteouſneſſe. For all vncleaneneſſe was waſhed awaye with water, that men ſhould not come vnto God, but pure and cleane. In Bloud was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and pledge of a full reconciliation with God.

And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye touching the bloud wherewith Chriſt hath pacified GOD, there is no doubt but it may bée demaunded howe he came by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For it is not probable that this is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:7582:108"/> to Baptiſme. Truly I thinke that <hi>Iohn</hi> doth héere expreſſe the fruit and effect of that thing which he declareth in the hiſtorie of his Goſpell. For whereas there hée ſayth, that water and bloud did iſſue out of the ſide of Chriſt, no doubt it is to bée accounted for a myracle. I doe knowe that ſome ſuch thing doth naturally come vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead: but it came to paſſe by the determinate counſaile of God, that the ſide of Chriſt ſhoulde be a fountaine of bloud and water: that the faithfull might knowe that true cleanneſſe (whereof the olde Baptiſmes were figures) is aſſured vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him: that they might knowe alſo that it is fulfilled which all the ſprinklings of bloud did in times paſt promiſe.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth was ſhewed in Chriſt: becauſe the lawe had nothing but the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhaddowes.

                  <p n="7">7 <hi>There are three in heauen.</hi> All this hath bene left out by ſome, <hi>Hierome</hi> thinketh that that was done of malice rather then of error: and truely of the Latines onely. But ſéeing that neither indéede the Gréeke copies doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée betwéen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, I dare ſcarce affirme any thing: yet becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the text doth run ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, if this part be added, &amp; I ſée that it is had in the beſt and moſt allowed copies: I doo willingly receiue it, &amp; the ſence ſhal be, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god to the end he may more plentifully confirme our faith in Chriſt, doth by a thrée fold means witneſſe, that we muſt reſt in him. For as our faith doth acknowledge three perſons in one being of God, ſo it is called vnto Chriſt by ſo many means, that it may reſt it ſelfe in him. Whereas he ſaith that thrée are one, it is not referred vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beeing, but rather vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the conſent. As if he ſhould ſaye, that the
<pb facs="tcp:7582:109"/> Father, and his euerlaſting worde, and the Spirite, doe with one conſent equallye ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue Chriſt. Therefore ſome bookes haue <hi>[Eis En]</hi> that is, Into one. But, although thou readeſt <hi>[En Eiſen]</hi> that is, Are one, as it is in other Copies, yet there is no doubt, but that the Father, the Word, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, are ſayd to be one, in the ſelfe ſame ſence, in which afterwards, Bloud, Water, and the Spirite. But whereas the Spirite, which is one witneſſe, is twice rehearſed: the repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſéemeth to be vnfit. I anſwere: Seing he doth witneſſe diuerſly of Chriſt, that a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place of witneſſing is fitlye giuen vnto him. For the Father, with his euerlaſting wiſedome and the Spirite, doeth pronounce from heauen as by his abſolute power, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is Chriſt. Therefore in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place the onely maieſtie of his diuinitie is to be conſidered of vs: and bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit dwelling in our harts is the earneſt, pledge, and ſeale, to ſeale vp that decrée: by this meanes he ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in earth by his grace. But becauſe it may be, that all men will not receiue this reading: I will ſo expound thoſe words that follow, as if the Apoſtle had named theſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſes on earth.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 <hi>Are three.</hi> He applyeth nowe that
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7582:109"/> ſentence of water and bloud, to his purpoſe, namely, that they haue no excuſe which refuſe Chriſt: foraſmuch as he hath prooued with ſufficient ſtrong and plaine witneſſes, that it is he which was promiſed long before. For bloud and water, ſéeing that they are pledges and effects of ſaluation brought by him, doo truly witneſſe that he is ſent of God. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Holy Ghoſt is added as a third wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whome notwithſtanding hath the firſt place: becauſe otherwiſe water and bloude ſhoulde haue iſſued without profit. For it is he which doth ſeale vp in our hearts the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of water and bloud: it is he, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to paſſe by his power, that the fruite of the death of Chriſt dooth come vnto vs: yea rather, that bloud being ſhed for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, dooth pearce euen vnto our ſoules: or, (that I may ſpeake all in one worde) it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that Chriſt with all his benefits is ours. So <hi>Paule Rom.</hi> 1.4. After y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſayd that Chriſt was ſhewed to bée the ſonne of God, by the power of his reſurrection, doeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly adde by the ſanctifieng of the Spirite. Becauſe whatſoeuer tokens of the heauenly glorie doeth ſhine in Chriſt: they ſhoulde bée neuer the leſſe darke vnto vs, and ſhould bée farre from our ſight, vnleſſe the ſpirite did
<pb facs="tcp:7582:110"/> open vnto vs the eyes of faith. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doo vnderſtand, why <hi>Iohn</hi> hath brought the ſpirite as witneſſe with water &amp; bloud: namely becauſe it is the proper office of the Spirite, to make cleane our conſciences by the bloude of Chriſt: and to cauſe, that the cleanſing brought by him, is effectuall in vs.</p>
                  <p>Of which thing ther is ſomething ſpoken in the beginning of the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Peter,</hi> chap. 1. verſe. 22. where <hi>Peter</hi> vſeth almoſt the ſame ſpeach: to wit, that the holy Ghoſt doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth purge our ſoules by the ſprinkeling of the bloud of Chriſt. But by theſe words we may gather, that faith dooth not take holde of Chriſt bare or naked: but with all his quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening power. For what profite were it that Chriſt, was ſent into the earth, vnleſſe he had pacified God by the ſacrifice of his death? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the office of cleanſing had bene inioyned him of his father? yet it may be obiected that the diſtinction is ſuperfluous, which is héere ſet downe, becauſe Chriſt by putting awaye ſinne, hath made vs cleane. Therefore the Apoſtle nameth one thing twice. I graunt indéede, that in the putting awaye of ſinne, there is alſo included a waſhing.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I haue not ſet a difference of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7582:110"/> water and bloud, as though they wer diuers things. But if euery one of vs doo weigh his owne weakeneſſe, he ſhall eaſelye acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that bloud is not in vaine or without cauſe diſcerned from water.</p>
                  <p>Further, as it hath bene alreadie ſaide, the Apoſtle alludeth vnto the Rytes of the Lawe. But God did in times paſte inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, not onely Sacrifice but alſo waſhings becauſe of the weakneſſe of man. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle woulde plainelye expreſſe that the truth of both parts was offered vs in Chriſt. By which reaſon, he ſayde a little before, <hi>Not in water onely.</hi> For hee dooth ſignifie that not onelye ſome parte of our ſaluation is founde in Chriſt, but alſo all partes full, ſo that nothing more is to be ſought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 <hi>If the witneſſe of men.</hi> He reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the leſſe to the greater, howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull men are, if they refuſe Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued from heauen, ſo as he hath ſaid. For, if in mens affaires we doo reſt in the wordes of men, which can lye and deceiue, how vnſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall it be, that God hath loſſe credit with vs, in his owne matters, wherein he is the cheefe Iudge? Therefore onely iniquitie doth
<pb facs="tcp:7582:111"/> let, that we receiue not Chriſt, when as hée giueth creditte to his power by a lawfull proofe. Further, he calleth the witneſſe of God, not onely that which the Spirite dooth giue into our harts, but that alſo which we haue from water &amp; bloud. For that power of purging and putting away ſinne, was not earthly but heauenly. Wherefore the bloud of Chriſt is not to be eſtéemed after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon manner of men: but we muſt rather reſpect the purpoſe of God, wherein it was ordained to put awaye ſinne, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlye power, which hath flowed from thence.</p>

For after that the Apoſtle had taught that God doth deſerue much more credite then men: now he addeth that we can giue no creditte vnto God, but by beléeuing in Chriſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God dooth ſet him onely before vs, and dooth ſtay vs in him. Hence he gathereth that we doo beléeue in Chriſt ſafely and with qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et mindes, becauſe God doth eſtabliſh our faith by his owne authoritie. Neither dooth he ſay that God dooth ſpeake outwardly, but that euery one of the godly doth féele him the Authour of his faith inwardly in himſelfe. Whereby it appeareth how much an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant opinion which hangeth vppon ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, doth differ from faith.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 <hi>He that doth not beleeue.</hi> As the faithfull haue this commoditie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they know themſelues to be without daunger of errour, becauſe they are grounded vppon God: ſo he maketh the vngodly guiltie of great blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, becauſe they accuſe God of a lie.

Therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he may ſtur vs vp to beléeue,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:112"/> he taketh an argument fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contrarie. For if it be an horrible and curſed wickedneſſe, to make God a liar: becauſe then, that which is moſt proper vnto him is taken awaie: who would not feare to abaſe the credit of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: wherein God will eſpecially be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted true and faithfull? This is dilligently to be noted. Some meruaile why God doth ſo much commend faith: why vnfaithfulneſſe is ſo ſharply condemned. But héere the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit glorie of God is in queſtion. For ſéeing he woulde giue forth a ſpeciall ſhew of his truth in the Goſpell, they leaue him nothing, whoſoeuer refuſe Chriſt therein offered. Wherefore that we may graunt that ſome man maye in ſome other partes of his lyfe, be equall vnto an Angell: yet his holyneſſe is diuelliſh, ſo long as he reiecteth Chriſt. As we ſée certaine in the Papacie much to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues with I know not what viſor of holineſſe: when as yet they reſiſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell moſt obſtinatly. Therefore let vs holde, that this is the beginning of godlyneſſe, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently to imbrace that doctrine which hee hath ſo faythfullye auouched for a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <p>And truly the words of the Apoſtle haue this drift, that we muſt not onely reuerently obeye the Goſpell, leaſt wée doe iniurye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: but alſo that it is to bée beloued, becauſe it bringeth vnto vs eternall lyfe. From whence alſo wée doo gather, what is chiefely and moſt of all to be ſought for in the Goſpell of Chriſt, to wit, the free guift of eternall redemption and ſaluation. For ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God of his goodneſſe dooth there exhorte vs vnto repentaunce and feare, it ought not to be ſeparated from the grace of Chriſt. And that the Apoſtle maye ſtaye and detaine vs whollye in the eternall grace of Chriſt, he repeateth vnto vs again, that euerlaſting life is contained in him alone: as if hée ſhoulde haue ſayde, that there is no other meanes at all ſet downe vnto vs by GOD
<pb facs="tcp:7582:113"/> the father to obtaine life. And indéede the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath briefly héere comprehended thrée things, to wit that we are all appoynted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, vntill God of his frée goodneſſe doo reſtore vs to life. For he plainly ſayth, that lyfe is giuen by God. Whereby alſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that we are diſappoynted of it, and that it cannot be gotten by deſerts. Further he teacheth that this life is giuen vnto vs by the Goſpell, becauſe there is layde open the goodneſſe and fatherly loue of God towardes vs. Laſtly he ſaith, that we are by no other meanes made pertakers of that lyfe, then when we are ingrafted into Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 <hi>He that hath not.</hi> It is a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſentence going before. Indéed that ought to ſuffice, that God hath placed lyfe no where els but in Chriſt, that it maye be ſought for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. But leaſt any man ſhould decline another way, he ſhutteth out all men from the hope of life, which ſéeke it not in Chriſt. We knowe what it is to haue Chriſt: for he is poſſeſſed by faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he depriueth all men of life, which are not of the bodie of Chriſt. But this ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to agrée with reaſon.

I aunſwere: that we are farre deceiued, if we thinke that whatſoeuer dooth excel in our eyes is allowed of God. Yea rather, as it is in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.15. that which is excellent in the ſight of men, is abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before God. Foe becauſe the vncleanneſſe of the heart is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto vs, we are content with the outward ſhew. But God dooth ſée moſt filthy wickedneſſe lying hid vnder the ſame. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is no meruaile if thoſe vertues which beare an outward ſhew, doo ſtink before him, which both procéede from an vncleane heart, and alſo tende not to a good ende. Further, whence is the cleanneſſe of the heart, whence is a good indeauour of godlineſſe, but from the ſpirite of Chriſt? Then nothing is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of praiſe, but in Chriſt. Although ther is another reaſon, which taketh away al doubt. For the righteouſneſſe of men, conſiſteth in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. If thou take away this, the vndoubted curſſe of God, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death, remaineth for vs all, and it is onely Chriſt, which reconcileth the father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as he hath once pacified him by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his death.</p>

                  <p>Whence it followeth, that God is mercifull to man, but in Chriſt: and that there is no righteouſneſſe but in him. If any man obiect <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Moreouer, the Apoſtle teacheth in this place, that Chriſt is the proper ſcope of faith: and that the aſſurance of ſaluation is ioyned with the faith which we haue in his name. For this is the ende of beléeuing, that we may be the children, and heires of God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 <hi>This is the truſt.</hi> He commendeth the faith whereof he ſpake, by the fruite: or he dooth ſhewe wherein our truſt dooth chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt: to wit, that the godly are bolde to call vpon God with a bolde courage, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſpeaketh, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.12. That by faith wée haue acceſſe vnto God with boldneſſe. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. that the Spirite dooeth open our
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7582:115"/> mouths, that we doubt not to crye <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> And truly if we be kept from comming to God, nothing is more miſerable, then wée. Againe, ſo this ſanctuarie may be opened for vs, we ſhal be neuertheleſſe bleſſed in all our miſeries. Yea, this one thing maketh all our miſeries happie, that we are certainlye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that God will be our deliuerer, and truſting in his fatherly good will towardes vs, we flye vnto him. Let vs therefore holde this ſentence of the Apoſtle, that calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God, is the eſpeciall triall of our faith: and that God is not called vpon a right, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according vnto faith, but when as wée are perſwaded that our prayers ſhall not be in vayne. For the Apoſtle dooth denie, that they are indued with confidence, which hang in doubt. Whereby it appeareth, that the doctrine of faith, is buried and almoſt quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the Papacie, where all certaintie is taken away. Indéede they murmure manye prayers there, and they prate much of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon God: but they pray, &amp; bid to pray with doubtfull and wandring mindes: yea, they condemne this truſt, which the Apoſtle dooth neceſſarily require.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>According to his will.</hi> By this note hée would briefely teach, what is the true rule
<pb facs="tcp:7582:116"/> to pray: to wit, when men ſubmit their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vnto God. Neither indéede when as the Lord did promiſe that he would doo, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer his ſhould require, did he graunt vnto them an vnbridled libertie to aſke whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came into their minde: but he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withall a lawe to praye aright. And truely there is nothing more profitable for vs, then this bridle: becauſe if it be lawfull for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one of vs to aſke whatſoeuer he liſt, and God doo fauour our prayers, we ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill prouided for. For we know not what is profitable: yea, we doo boyle with wicked and hurtfull deſires. But God dooth giue a double remedie, that we pray not otherwiſe then according to the preciſe rule of his wil: becauſe he dooth both teach vs by his worde, what he wil haue vs to aſke, and alſo he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth appoynt his ſpirite our guide and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which may ſtay our affections, and not ſuffer them to wander without theyr boundes. For we know not, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> what and how we ought to pray: but the ſpirite helping our infirmities, dooth ſtirre vp in vs vnſpeakable ſighings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. In the meane time alſo we muſt aſke at the mouth of the Lord, that he will direct our praiers. For God in his promiſes dooth ſet down vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7582:116"/> vs the lawful meanes to pray, as hath ben ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 <hi>And if we knowe.</hi> The repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not néedleſſe, as in ſhew it ſéemeth. For the Apoſtle now ſpeciallye affirmeth, that which he generally pronounced of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſucceſſe of praier, that the godly do wiſh or deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God, which they do not obtaine, and when as he ſaith, that all the prayers of the faithfull are heard, he ſpeaketh of ſound and modeſt prayers, and which are framed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of obedience. For the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full do not runne headlong with looſe raines or graunt themſelues any thing: but they alwayes in their praiers regard what God commandeth. Therefore this is the applying of the generall doctrine to the ſpirituall and priuate vſe of euery man: that the faithfull doo not doubt that they haue God fauourable in all and euery their praiers, that they may with quiet mindes waite vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme thoſe things which they haue prayed for: and ſo being eaſed of all griefe and care, they caſt their cares vpon God.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet this quietneſſe and aſſuraunce, ought to quench in vs the zeale of prayer: that he which is aſſured of an happie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſhould therefore abſtaine from calling
<pb facs="tcp:7582:117"/> vpon God. For the certaintie of faith dooth not bring foorth vntowardneſſe or ſlacknes. But the Apoſtle onely meaneth that euerye man be quiet minded in his neceſſities, when he hath laid downe his gronings, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of God.</p>

But he denieth that they are ſinnes vnto death, not onelye wherein the Saints doo daily offend: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo if at any time it come to paſſe that they grieuouſly prouoke the wrath of God.

And yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle dooth not héere diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte veniall and deadly ſin, as afterwards was commonly done. For that diſtinction which preuayled in the Papacie, is moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauorie. The Sorbonniſts acknowledge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no ſinne to be deadly, except wherein
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7582:118"/> there appeareth ſuch groſe vncleanneſſe, that it may be felt with hands. So amongſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes they accompt the moſt horrible filthineſſe, which lurketh in the minde. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, all the fruites of originall ſin, ſo that they breake not out into externall acte, they thinke to be done away with a light ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of holy water. And what maruell when they doo not accompt the blaſphemous doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the grace of God, and whatſoeuer luſts and concupiſcences to be ſinne, ſo that the conſent be not withall? If the minde of man be ſhaken with vnbeléefe, if impatience doo prouoke him, that he murmure agaynſt God, how much ſoeuer monſtrous luſts doo mooue him: all this is lighter with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, then that he be ouertaken in ſinne, at the leaſt after baptiſme. Therefore it is no maruel if of greuous offences they can make venial ſins: for they weigh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their own &amp; not with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ballance of god. But among the faithful this principle muſt be vndoubted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of god, is ſin, &amp; that deadly by his own nature.

<pb facs="tcp:7582:119"/> Yet God dooth not ſo ſeuerely puniſh them, Therefore he dooth not weigh the ſinnes in themſelues, but he iudgeth of them according to the fatherly kindneſſe of God, which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth the guiltineſſe, where yet there was offence. Finally, he dooth not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouer to death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God hath reſtored to life by raiſing them againe, albeit they letted not why they ſhould not haue ben ſhut out from life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a ſinne vnto death.</hi> I haue ſayd alreadie that ſinne is called ſo, whereto there is lefte no hope of forgiuenes. But it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what manner of ſinne that is. For it muſt néedes be very gréeuous, which God ſo ſeuerely puniſheth. It may be gathered by the courſe of the text, that the fall was not in part, as they ſay, nor the tranſgreſſion of one precept: but a generall falling away, where by men doo vtterlye eſtraunge themſelues from God. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtle addeth afterwards, that the ſonnes of God doo not ſinne: that is, that they forſake not God, and giue ouer and imbondage themſelues whollye vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
                  <p>It is no meruaile if ſuch a fallyng awaye be a deadly ſinne. For God dooth neuer ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue his children of the grace of his ſpirite, but that they receiue ſome ſparke of godly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7582:119"/> Therefore they muſt néedes be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and giuen ouer vnto death, who ſo fall awaie, that they caſt away the feare of God. If anie aſke whether the waie of ſaluation be ſhut vp againſt their repentaunce: The anſwere is readie, That ſéeing they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer vnto a reprobate ſence, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the holy Ghoſt, they can doe no other thing, then runne headlong into worſe, and adde ſinne vnto ſinne. Further, ſéeing ſinne or blaſphemie againſt the Spirit, doth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drawe with it ſuch a falling awaie, there is no doubt but it is noted heere. But it is aſked againe by what markes we may know that the fall of man is deadly. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there were certaine knowledge of that thing, the Apoſtle ſhuld except in vaine, that we muſt not praie for that kinde of ſinne. Therefore it ſhall bée lawfull ſometimes to determine whether he be paſt hope that hath falne, or that there be yet place to recouerie. I graunt indéed that that is true: and it is proued without controuerſie by this place. But becauſe this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth but ſeldly to paſſe, &amp; god commending the infinit riches of his grace, commandeth vs by his example to be merciful: the iudgement of eternall death is not raſhly to be giuen vppon anie man: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:7582:120"/> loue dooth incline vs to hope well. But if the deſperate wickedneſſe of ſome men doo appeare vnto vs no otherwiſe, then if the Lord did poynt it out with the finger, there is not why we ſhoulde ſtriue with the iuſt iudgement of God, or deſire to be more fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then he.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 <hi>Euery vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi> This place may be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded diuerſly, for if thou reſolue it into the contrarie part, the ſenſe ſhall not be amiſſe thus, Albeit all, vnrighteouſneſſe is ſinne, yet ther is ſome ſin not vnto death.

Yet I doo more willingly allowe of the firſt or ſecond expoſition: and becauſe they fall both to one end, I leaue the iudgement frée to the readers, which of them be more fit.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 <hi>We know that whoſoeuer is of God.</hi> If thou takeſt the children of god to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether cleane and frée from ſinne, as fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call men doo faine, the Apoſtle ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to himſelfe, for by this meanes, hée
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7582:120"/> ſhould take away from amongſt bretheren the indeauour of praying. Therfore he ſaith they doo not ſinne, which fall not vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the grace of God. And hence hée would inferre, that we muſt pray for all the children of God: becauſe they ſinne not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. The proofe is added, Becauſe euery one that is borne of God, kéepeth himſelfe, that is, dooth kéepe himſelfe in the feare of God: &amp; ſuffereth not himſelfe ſo to be with violence carried away, that the ſenſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe béeing extinguiſhed, he whollye gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelfe to the diuell and to the fleſh. For when he ſaith, <hi>That he is not touched of that wicked one.</hi> It is to be referred to the deadly wound. For the children of GOD are not frée from the woundes of Sathan: but they ſo beate backe his ſtrokes with the ſhield of faith, that they pearce not to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart. Therefore the ſpirituall life is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer extinguiſhed in them. This is that <hi>Not to ſinne,</hi> when the godly doo indéede fall tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the infirmitie of the fleſh: but they mourne vnder the burden of ſinne, they are diſpleaſed with themſelues, they ceaſe not to feare God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Keepeth himſelfe.</hi> That which is proper

The defenders of frée will ſnatch vp this ſpéech, that they might therby proue, that wee are deliuered from ſinne, partly by the grace of God, and partly by our owne power. But they doe not obſerue, that the faithfull haue not of themſelues the keeping whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh. Nor indéede doth he héere publiſh their ſtrength, as if they did kéepe themſelues by their owne power: but onely he teacheth that they reſiſt Satan, that they be neuer deadly wounded with his dartes. And we know that we are neuer prepared to battaile with anie other armour then the armour of God. Let therefore the faithfull kéepe themſelues from ſinne, euen as they are kept of God.</p>

This is life eternall, that they know thée the very true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that he maye lighten our mindes to the knowledge of God For ſéeing he is the very image of the inuiſible God, ſéeing the onely interpreter of the father, ſéeing the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuer of life: yea life, the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and truth, ſo ſoone as we depart from him, it
<pb facs="tcp:7582:123"/> is of neceſſitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we vaniſh away in our own inuentions. But Chriſt is ſayd, <hi>To haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs vnderſtanding,</hi> not onelye becauſe he ſheweth by the doctrine of the Goſpel who is the true God, &amp; dooth alſo inlighten vs with his ſpirit: but becauſe we haue in Chriſt him ſelfe God manifeſted in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. Euen as all fulneſſe of the Godhead dooeth dwell in him, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of knowledge and wiſedome are hidde, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. and 9. So it commeth to paſſe, that the open face of God, after a ſorte doeth ſhine vnto vs in Chriſt. Not that there was none, or a doubtfull knowledge of God before the comming of Chriſt: but becauſe now he hath manifeſted himſelfe more fully, &amp; as it wer in a meruailous cléerenes. And this is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. That god who in time paſt commaunded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, in the creation of the worlde, hath now ſhined in our hearts by the light of the knowledge of his glorie in the face of Chriſt. And we muſt note, that this gifte is peculiar to Gods elect onely. Chriſt indéede hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſet foorth to al, the light of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but al haue not ſéeing mindes to behold: but rather Satan dooth ſpredde the vaile of blindneſſe before the eyes of many. Therfore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7582:123"/> the apoſtle vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light which Chriſt kindleth within the harts of his children, and which once being kindled is neuer put out, albeit at ſome times it come to paſſe in ſome that it be hindered for a time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are in him which is true.</hi> By this word he dooth teach, how effectual that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, whereof he hath made mention: that is, becauſe by it we are grafted into Chriſt, &amp; made one with God. For it hath a liuelye roote, and truly ſetled in our hearts, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that God liueth in vs, &amp; we in him. Becauſe he ſaith without note of coupling together, <hi>We are in him that is true, in his ſonne,</hi> he ſéemeth to expreſſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our coniunction with God: as if hée ſhould haue ſaide: That we are in God by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſame is very God.</hi> Albeit the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> haue gone about to abuſe this place, and certaine at this daye ſubſcribe vnto them: yet héere we haue an excellent witneſſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie of Chriſt. The <hi>Arrians</hi> referre this to the Father, as if the Apoſtle ſhould again ſay that hée were true God. But the repetition ſhould be too fruitleſſe. He had twice alreadie teſtified y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was the true God, who appered vnto vs in Chriſt: to what ende ſhould hée
<pb facs="tcp:7582:124"/> by and by adde, <hi>This is true God?</hi> But it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth fitly vnto Chriſt. For after that he had taught that Chriſt was the guide by whoſe direction we were led vnto God: nowe, for amplification ſake he affirmeth, that Chriſt is that God, leaſt we ſhould thinke, that he is to be ſought a farre off. And the Epethite, <hi>Of eternall life,</hi> confirmeth the ſame. Indéede hée ſpeaketh both of one and the ſame that he is true God, and eternall life. I o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue <hi>[Outos]</hi> he vſeth to be reſtrained to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next perſon. This I ſay, that Chriſt is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called eternall life; &amp; it cannot be denied, that this manner of ſpeaking is vſuall with <hi>Iohn</hi> The ſumme is, when we haue Chriſt, that we enioy the true and eternall God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is no other where to be ſought. Then that we are ſo made pertakers of eternal life, becauſe being bidde in the father, it is offered vs in Chriſt. The father indeed is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of life: but the fountaine from whence we may draw it, is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 <hi>Little children keepe your ſelues from Idolls.</hi> Albeit it is a ſeuerall ſentence, yet it is that which hangeth vppon the former doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7582:124"/> of the godly. And the Apoſtle dooth not onely condemne idolatrie, but he commandeth that they take héede vnto themſelues of the idolls themſelues. Whereby he ſignifieth, that the ſound and ſincere worſhip of God cannot be kept, ſo ſoone as men begin to haunt images. For ſo is ſuperſtition bred in vs, that euerye leaſt cauſe dooth infect vs with the poyſon of it. Drie woode will not ſo ſoone burne, being laid vpon the coales, as idolatrie wil ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and poſſeſſe the mindes of men, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is offered them. Who ſéeth not that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages are ſparks? Why doo I cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſparks? Yea rather fire-brands, which may ſuffice to ſet the whole world on fire.

Further, the Papiſts are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, who wreſt this to the pictures of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercurie</hi> and ſuch like: as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed the Apoſtle doth not generally teach, that it is a corrupting of godlines, where there is vnto God imagined a bodely ſhape, or where images &amp; pictures are ſet vp to worſhip. Let vs therfore remember, that we muſt ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful continue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpiritually worſhip of God, that we driue far away from vs, whatſoeuer may bend vs to groſe &amp; carnall ſuperſtitions.</p>

For thei are ſpeciallie accompted the ſeruauntes of Chriſt, to whom he hath appointed ſome publique office. And wee knowe to what ende, the Apoſtles vſe to dignifie them ſelues with this title. He doeth not rightly arrogate to himſelf, the right and authoritie of teachyng who ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is not called. Therefore, their calling is a witneſſe vnto the Apoſtles, that thei doe not thruſt in themſelues, of their owne priuate braine. Although this alone were not ſufficient of it ſelf, that thei are placed in office, vnleſſe thei did behaue them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
<pb facs="tcp:7582:127"/> faithfullie in the ſame. And truelie he comprehendeth bothe, whiche ſaieth, that he is the ſeruaunt of God: to witte, that he hath GOD the aucthour of the function, which he exerciſeth, and alſo that he doeth faithfullie execute that whiche is enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hym. And becauſe verie many doe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlie pretende this title, and doe falſly boſte them ſelues to bee that, whiche thei are moſte farre from, wee muſte alwaies ſee whether the thyng it ſelf dooe agree with the profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brother of James,</hi> He addeth a name, whiche was more knowne and renoumed to the Churche. For although the credite and authoritie of doctrine, doeth hang vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon no mortall man, yet this is a greate ſtaie vnto faithe, when as the ſoundeneſſe of the man is knowne vnto vs, whiche is the teacher. And that the authoritie of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, is not here pretended, as of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate manne: but becauſe that among all men, he was taken to be vnto the Churche one of the cheef Apoſtles of Chriſte. And he was the Sonne of <hi>Alpheus,</hi> as I haue ſaied in an other place. Yea, this place ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb facs="tcp:7582:127"/> for me againſt <hi>Euſebius</hi> and others, who write that a Diſciple, I knowe not who called <hi>Oblia,</hi> was he of whom <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaketh in the <hi>Actes 15.13.</hi> &amp; <hi>21.18.</hi> which was more excellent then the Apoſtles in that Churche. But there is no doubte, but Iude doeth call hym here his Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was famous amongeſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Therefore it is likely that it was he, vnto whom <hi>Luke</hi> telleth, that there was ſpeciall honour giuen by the reſte. <hi>To the whiche are called in God.</hi> He noteth all the faithfull by this name, becauſe that the Lorde hath ſeperated them vnto hym ſelf. But becauſe callyng is nothyng, but the effecte of the eternall election, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken for it. In this place in ſkilleth little, whether waie thou doe expounde it. For in deede he commendeth the grace of God, whereby he vouchſafeth to chuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto hymſelf for a peculiar people.</p>
               <p>And he ſignifieth that men doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent God, neither at any tyme doe come vnto hym, vntill he drawe them. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth theim alſo ſanctified in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whiche wee maie tranſlate by God
<pb facs="tcp:7582:128"/> the Father. Yet I haue kept that forme of ſpeeche, that the readers might haue their free iudgement. For, this alſo maie be the ſenſe, that beyng prophane in themſelues, thei haue ſanctification in God. Further, the maner of Sanctification is, When he doeth regenerate vs by his Spirite. The other readyng that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon interpreter hath followed, is ſomewhat harder, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is to ſaie, to the beloued in God the Father. Therefore I iudge that it is corrupted, and truely it is founde in fiue bookes. He addeth further, that thei are kept in Chriſte. For wee ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Sathans, ſubiecte to Death, in ſo muche as he would catche vs an hundreth tymes, euery momente, as a readie praie, vnleſſe wee were ſafe vnder the defence of Chriſte: whom the Father hath therefore giuen vnto vs to be our keeper, that none of thoſe thynges ſhould bee loſte, whiche he hath receiued into his Faithe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Therefore Iude doeth here ſhewe a threefold benefite of God in all the godly: That he hath made them pertakers of the Goſpell by his callyng, that he hath rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb facs="tcp:7582:128"/> theim into newneſſe of life by his Spirite, and that he hath kepte theim by the hande of Chriſte, that thei ſhould not faile of their Saluation.</p>

As wee are wont to ſaie, that thei whiche doe burne with ſome earneſt deſire, can not ſtaie them ſelues, therefore accordyng to theim, there was a neceſſitie in this, that the deſire to write, did not ſuffer Iude to bee ſilent.</p>
               <p>But I rather thinke that there are here twoo ſeuerall members. That when otherwaies he was readie enough, and
<pb facs="tcp:7582:129"/> carefully giuen to write, neceſſitie alſo did conſtraine hym.

Therefore in this firſt place Iude te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, that he had ſo greate a care of their Saluation, that he deſired to write of his owne accorde, and that in deede withall his harte. Then, that he might ſtirre vp their attentiueneſſe, he ſaith together that the matter did require it ſhould be ſo. For neceſſitie giueth ſharpe ſpurres. Excepte thei had been premoniſhed, how greatelie needefull this exhortation would bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: Thei might haue been ſlowe and careleſſe to read. But when he foretelleth that he doeth write, by meane of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſitie, it is as if he ſhould ſound a retire, to ſhake of their drouſineſſe.</p>

For the ſpeeche will bee but bablyng, if wee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Saluation emongeſt other menne, whereof wee our ſelues haue no feelyng. Therefore Iude profeſſeth hym ſelf to bee a teacher, conning in practiſe, when in the nomber of the godlie, he dooeth aſſemble hym ſelf into the fellowſhipp of the ſame Saluation.</p>

                  <hi>The grace of our God.</hi> Now he ſheweth more plainly, what maner of miſcheef it was.

<pb facs="tcp:7582:133"/> feare. Becauſe if any doe mocke God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſorte, the contempte of his glorie ſhall not goe in vaine. He ſheweth this by three examples. For firſte he calleth to minde the puniſhement, whiche God exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted vpon the vnbeleeuers whom beyng redeemed by his power, he had choſen to be his people. Almoſte the like compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in Paule, in his firſt to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> the tenth Chapter.

For the condition of Angels was of more accompt then ours: and yet God puniſhed that fallyng awaie, for a moſte horrible example. Therefore, he will not ſpare our vnfaithfulneſſe, if we fall awaie from the grace, wherevnto he hath called vs. In deede this puniſhment, whiche was laied vppon the Citizens of Heauen and ſuche excellent Miniſters of God, ought to be daiely conuerſant before our eyes: leaſt at any tyme we bee carried into the contempt of the grace of GOD, from whence wee violently fall headlong into deſtruction: <gap reason="foreign">

The greeuouſneſſe of the puniſhment is alſo to bee marked, whiche the Apoſtle ſheweth. Not onely free ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, but heauenly Principalities, are now held bounde in perpetuall chaines. Thei did not onely enioye the glorious light of God, but his brightneſſe did ſhine in them, that from thence as it were, he might powre out hymſelf, as by beames into all partes of the world: Now thei are plunged vnder darkeneſſe. Further, wee are not to imagine a place wherein the Deuilles are ſhut. For the Apoſtle meant to teach plainly, how miſerable their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, ſince by their fallyng awaie, thei are depriued of their dignitie. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoeuer thei goe, thei drawe their chai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes with them, and remain ouerwhelmed in their darkeneſſe.

                  <hi>7 As Sodome and Gomorrha.</hi> This e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample is more generall. For he ſheweth
<pb facs="tcp:7582:134"/> that God (no ſorte of men excepted) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently execute puniſhment vppon all the wicked. And Iude himſelf doeth after make mention, that the burnyng where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the fiue Cities periſhed, was a figure of eternall fire. Therefore God did then appoinct an excellent inſtruction, whiche might keepe men in feare to the worldes ende.

Wherefore, Iude doth not without cauſe implie a terror to all worldes, by ſettyng before them ſuche a ſpectacle.

               <p>I knowe in deede, that many fooliſhe thinges haue béen receiued vnder this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as the Papiſtes at this daie recken in this accompte, euery ſenceleſſe dotage of the Monkes.

               <p>Wherfore, for this teſtimony, although it be not found in Scripture, this Epiſtle ought not to be called into doubt.

By this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will ſhortly be condemned the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of faithe, whiche doeth more kindle the rage of the wicked. Finally, according to theſe Iudgers it will not be good to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Chriſt, except in proſperitie. Paule did not without cauſe,<note place="margin">Galat. 4.29.</note> place the ſcoffings of Iſraell in the higheſt degree of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: becauſe therein is more daunger by deriding, and reproches, then by armed
<pb facs="tcp:7582:148"/> crueltie. If the wicked ſee vs preſſed with aduerſitie, thei triumph at our afflictions. Here if our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie doth begin to quaile, thei hurt more greeuouſly with their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des then with ſworde. But that ſaiyng of Paule was to be held: becauſe we truſt in the liuing God, wee muſt not onely ſuffer perſecution, but ſlaunders. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call to remembraunce the example of Chriſt, whom Sathan laboured to wound with his venemous Darte. He truſted in God, let hym deliuer hym if he will, leaſt we ſtumble ſo oft as we ſéeme to be giuen vnto the deſire of the enemies. But if at the firſt puſhe the Bretheren be either fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or diſquieted, it is your duetie to ſtaie them vp, leaſt thei fall doune, or alſo to raiſe them vp, that thei maie againe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ſtrength: and not therfore to faile from their godlie endeuour, becauſe it gaue the wicked an occaſion to be cruell. For if the matter be weighed by it ſelf, the aunſwere will be plaine, that their priuate and ſecrete meetynges, were not laied to the Apoſtles charge for a fault. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious enemies might then alſo obiect,
<pb facs="tcp:7582:148"/> that men and women could not come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the night and ſecretly without ſuſpition. And there is no doubte but thei were burdened with many ſlaunders: and when a Gariſon of Souldiers kept watch at Ieruſalem, this might ſeeme to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the publique peace. And yet they ceaſed not for all that.<note place="margin">Act. 12.12.</note> We ſee that when Peter was taken priſoner, thei were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the houſe of a widowe. Neither is it needefull here to gather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, becauſe it is knowne to haue béen in daiely vſe with them: as Hiſtories wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the godly Martirs haue had ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues for their Churches. All be it this was ſubiect to no ſmal reproof, that thei might bee ſuſpected either of theft, or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickedneſſe: yet becauſe neceſſitie did ſo enforce, thei deſpiſed with valiaunt myndes the reproches whiche thei knewe to be commonly ſpread. So now our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren are armed with a moſte excellent defence, if Magiſtrates will ſuffer them freely and openly to call vppon the name of God, that thei will then gladly come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, nor will thei doe any thyng in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete:
<pb facs="tcp:7582:149"/> but becauſe by their tyrannie thei are forbid, yet that thei follow that meane whiche is moſte farre from tumulte. The ſame is to bee thought of Matrimonie, whoſe bleſſyng (as thei call it) in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie is meere prophanation. And yet in reſpect of politicall order, it can not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſecrete Mariage, whereof there is a Regeſter kept. But that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holineſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould be polluted and defiled with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, is by no meanes to be ſuffred. All be it night Burialles are not without cauſe condemned by the Lawes: yet in vaine doe thei cloake their delicateneſſe, who in the Burialles of their freends, do wrapp and intangle them ſelues with old Sacriledges. The ſame reaſon ought to holde in Baptiſme. For all be it there bee before them a moſte preſent daunger, yet will not that therefore be lawfull, whiche God doeth manifeſtly forbid. We knowe that in the Papacie Baptiſme is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many defilynges, and is almoſte adulterated. If no feare hinder, it wil eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee agreed vnto among all the godlie, that it is not lawfull for Fathers to offer
<pb facs="tcp:7582:149"/> their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a defiled Baptiſme. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to take an excuſe by the daunger is too friuolous, as if the matter it ſelf ſhould thereby chaunge the nature thereof. For wee knowe that the teſtimonie of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is more worth before God, then that it ought to giue place either to threatnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or terrors, at the leaſt where feare doeth vrge vs to diſſimulation, whiche is a ſecrete approuing of that which is euill. Wherefore, as for charities ſake wee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together with our Bretheren: ſo it is not in our power to free them from the inſoluble lawe of God, whiche by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes maie bee broken.<note place="margin">Exod. 1.17.</note> And if the Iewiſhe women in tymes paſt did not feare in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt,</hi> to deliuer the children of other men from the ſworde of <hi>Pharao,</hi> to put their owne liues into daunger, it is foule for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes to bee amazed with feare, that ſo muche as in them lieth, thei defile the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of their children. Theſe thynges I haue breefly written to you accordyng to the iudgement of our companie, good ſir, and right reuerende Brother, the Lorde guide you alwaies with his Spirit, bleſſe
